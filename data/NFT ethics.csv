211,2022-05-17 12:16:29+00:00,https://twitter.com/jaxvestment,@NFTethics Thanks for the thread.  I was interested in getting into Azuki.  But not so sure that the layers are beginning to be pulled back.,https://twitter.com/jaxvestment/status/1526537137763532801

213,2022-05-17 12:05:19+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"25/ If you are ever caught lying, just say that you have been experimenting a bit with the truth, which to a certain extent can be regarded as the true essence of art. You will hopefully at some point wake up and smell the roses in the infinite Azuki/Ethereum garden. https://t.co/bQ5EgKs09E",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534325482639360
214,2022-05-17 12:05:17+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"24/ Linda Xie is very well connected in the NFT space, is a personal investor in OpenSea, a ""close friend of a16z‚Äù (in a16z‚Äôs own words). Zagabond quit his job at 0x Labs in September and was congratulated on Twitter by Linda Xie and Will Warren. https://t.co/SfDOtnvQ0P",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534317316489217
215,2022-05-17 12:05:15+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"23/ Scalar Capital is also an investor in Dfinity, which is the former employer of Whizwang (Elizabeth Yang), and Twitter shows that the 2 know each other. Whizwang deleted many tweets (for transparency purposes probably) but did mention that she was part of the zunks team. https://t.co/Hre7maeY1f",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534309628231680
216,2022-05-17 12:05:14+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"22/ It makes it even more shameless to see that in Scalar Capital‚Äôs pitch deck, they explicitly mention that they bought 0x at $0.048. Fun fact: Coinbase just announced 0x Labs as their NFT partner and the price of ZRX skyrocketed. https://t.co/l5KMkEr67F",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534302791516161
217,2022-05-17 12:05:12+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534295719923712
218,2022-05-17 12:05:11+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"20/ The 2 Scalar Capital founders were heavily involved in developing Coinbase‚Äôs listing procedures along with an engineer (Maksim Stepanenko), who was an advisor to Scalar. The sudden manner in which Coinbase listed 0x (price climbed up 17% within an hour) attracted suspicions. https://t.co/eaposggJkZ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534290225434624
219,2022-05-17 12:05:09+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,19/ Scalar Capital claimed that it provides ‚Äúasymmetric info‚Äù and ‚Äúearly access to projects‚Äù to its partners. We know that because a confidential pitch deck of Scalar Capital was leaked. It has some interesting slides. https://t.co/6GGMpwRPO9,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534284122660864
220,2022-05-17 12:05:07+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"18/ Scalar‚Äôs founders invested in 0x‚Äôs public token sale before Coinbase listed it. Scalar‚Äôs co-founder Linda Xie is married to Will Warren, co-founder of 0x Labs‚Äô, the last employer of Zagabond, where he was a founding member and worked for more than 4 years. https://t.co/NZ8b9QgMjI",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534275251720192
221,2022-05-17 12:05:06+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"17/ But it gets worse: The Block posted an article a couple of years ago about the connection between Coinbase, 0x Labs and Scalar Capital. They have removed that article, maybe because Mike Dudas now has his own fund backed by a16z. https://t.co/y3mXpKseMJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534268935147521
222,2022-05-17 12:05:04+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"16/ It is very common for the a16z partners to personally invest in VCs of former colleagues and ex-employees of companies that a16z invested in. Other examples are: Variant Fund, 1Confirmation and Polychain, but there are many more (part of the so called ‚ÄúCoinbase mafia‚Äù). https://t.co/FOdep2bPG3",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534262861836288
223,2022-05-17 12:05:02+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"15/ Indeed, a16z's Marc Andreessen &amp; Chris Dixon personally, but also the 2 co-founders of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, who after that started his own VC Paradigm, and became an advisor to 0x Labs. 0x Labs is a non profit org, but raised $70m from Coinbase &amp; Co. https://t.co/BGz3SOC5u7",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534255223922688
224,2022-05-17 12:05:01+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"14/ Linda Xie, after Coinbase, started a venture capital firm Scalar Ventures with Jordan Clifford, another ex-Coinbase employee. We already mentioned the deep ties between a16z &amp; Coinbase, so you can probably already guess who funded this venture. https://t.co/rp8iMYSGqJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534248672505857
225,2022-05-17 12:04:59+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"13/ Via an interview, we learn that he got introduced to crypto via his friend Linda Xie, herself a very early and well-connected crypto investor who used to work for AIG and then joined Coinbase. She also loves Azuki, but it gets more interesting. Audio: https://t.co/Kox1LDhwqJ https://t.co/4WzcYQcykH",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534240271273984
226,2022-05-17 12:04:57+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as ‚Äúlearning experiences‚Äù) and trust the process (don‚Äôt ask any questions, but ‚Äútrust us‚Äù). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534234390904833
227,2022-05-17 12:04:56+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,11/ Zagabond was asked about all the ICO scams and said: ‚Äúyou should at least have done as much work as you could have done on the project before trying to raise money‚Äù. Maybe he also forgot about that when raising money with his NFT projects and abandoning them. https://t.co/LfuM2qverZ,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534228132913154
228,2022-05-17 12:04:54+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because ‚Äúthere's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn‚Äôt think that that would also apply to the ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534221094916099
229,2022-05-17 12:04:52+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"9/ When looking at Zagabond‚Äôs digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534214300180481
230,2022-05-17 12:04:51+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"8/ Zagabond has an investment banking background (like quite a few NFT influencers) and moved after a brief stint at Amazon to Google, before spending the last 4 years at 0x Labs. He mentioned that he left his job in September 2021, which is confirmed by his now deleted tweet. https://t.co/rBN5DWZ30L",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534206481907714
231,2022-05-17 12:04:49+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"7/ We think @NFTherder might create a thread about Zagabond‚Äôs blockchain transactions (across the different projects that he was involved in), so we will focus on the IRL relationships. As we said before: https://t.co/l06l1l8clX",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534198709964801
232,2022-05-17 12:04:48+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"6/ We confirmed Zagabond‚Äôs identity via a couple of different sources: blockchain transactions, comparing his voice with an interview that he did a couple of years ago, and tweets with certain key persons such as Whizwang and certain key timings.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534196298121216
233,2022-05-17 12:04:47+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"5/ If you want to get backed by VCs and/or a corporate brand, you can‚Äôt have any skeletons in the closet and it‚Äôs possible that that was the reason for Azuki to ‚Äúcome clean‚Äù. They added R. Hatoyama as an advisor, who is also venture partner at Sozo Ventures, investor in Coinbase. https://t.co/gkSFonTvsR",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534192858791936
234,2022-05-17 12:04:46+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,4/ The main exit strategy currently for founders is that a project gets backed by VCs and/or a corporate (Web2) brand that puts a professional team in place and we have already seen that with some high profile projects.,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534185720094720
235,2022-05-17 12:04:45+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù, so the current state of the market is that ‚Äúbad news‚Äù for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534183295885312
236,2022-05-17 12:04:44+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are ‚Äúdedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication‚Äù. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534180376543232

566,2022-04-28 12:50:10+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"25/ Referring to Solano‚Äôs own words below, maybe BAYC is the ultimate crypto hack by some guys that are laughing all the way to the bank having deceived the VCs and their holders in a cryptographic way that aligns with the true nature of cryptography itself. https://t.co/ehDOA1fm2c",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660242954764288

569,2022-04-28 12:50:06+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"22/ Could it be that they wanted to address the notion of the freedom of speech and expression in various parts of society? Maybe.

570,2022-04-28 12:50:05+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,21/ The word ‚Äúnegro‚Äù is de facto ‚Äúbanned‚Äù and that also applies to the movie Emperor Tomato Ketchup. ‚ÄúNo Sass‚Äù is not a common expression (in particular not for males) and could refer to the fact that Nazi symbols are banned in quite a lot of countries (no SA/SS). https://t.co/EMmEwD8Y8p,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660223157477377
571,2022-04-28 12:50:03+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"20/ Not many people know that the first album of the smurfs in 1963 was banned in Anglo-saxon countries, because the original title was ‚ÄúThe black smurfs‚Äù.

573,2022-04-28 12:49:59+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"18/ In that puzzle, they do make use of some ingenious pattern combinations and some people have therefore made suggestions that the names of the BAYC founders might reveal more about them.

574,2022-04-28 12:49:58+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"17/ Gargamel mentioned in an interview that they ""knew all about what this world was"", things are not ""just random"" which can also be concluded from the complicated puzzle that BAYC posted that ultimately could only be deciphered by a team of professionals https://t.co/rtp0fdAY6t https://t.co/oYjLHfDYty",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660191062675458
575,2022-04-28 12:49:56+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"16/ We stumbled upon 4chan threads from 2014 &amp; 2016 that mentioned the term ‚ÄúKali Yuga‚Äù and a French far right politician tweeted about it in 2015. In July 2019, a Telegram group called the ""Kali Yuga Surfing Club"" opened, featuring alt-right/Nazi-centric memes. https://t.co/muPNRGbJqY",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660184343355396
576,2022-04-28 12:49:54+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"15/ We dived a bit deeper in the history of this, especially since the skull on that t-shirt seems to have some resemblances with BAYC‚Äôs logo and because Yuga Labs and ‚ÄúRiding the Kali Yuga‚Äù could also seem to be related.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660176625836032
577,2022-04-28 12:49:53+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,14/ There is one Twitter source that predates BAYC by more than a year and another source from an academic William Allchorn who recently wrote a book ‚ÄúMoving beyond Islamist Extremism‚Äù. We have provided their explanations in the screenshots below. https://t.co/YAmMwtVbqP,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660173593391105
578,2022-04-28 12:49:52+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"13/ Her Instagram account has now been deleted, but in her IG bio, she only mentioned one word: cowabunga.

579,2022-04-28 12:49:50+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"12/ The last entry of his blog was on 14 April 2020, and up until that point he always mentioned his girlfriend M., but when looking deeper at properties that were purchased after April 2020, we noticed that another name came up: Gabriella Falcon. https://t.co/ouf4A1hN9R",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660159185870849
580,2022-04-28 12:49:48+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"11/ So Greg Solano is basically the only person that could provide us with some hints.

581,2022-04-28 12:49:46+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"10/ We did indeed find that also Gregory Solano also graduated from the University of Maryland, and didn‚Äôt find anything about Wylie Aranow, apart from the fact that his father was very (in)famous and some of the info he revealed in interviews (""his gambling-problem days""). https://t.co/LyF9VFtQCQ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660143255998464
582,2022-04-28 12:49:44+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"9/ Then we move over to the 2 main founders, who came up with the idea.

583,2022-04-28 12:49:42+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"8/ The two devs of BAYC, Kerem Atalay and Zeshan Ali, both graduated from the University of Maryland (Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences), but apart from that, we have not been able to find much more about them. https://t.co/3UxSyU0Frn",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660126709456898
584,2022-04-28 12:49:41+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,7/ We have tried to look into the BAYC founders‚Äô histories (or whatever is available on the Internet and that‚Äôs not much) to see if it‚Äôs possible to understand what their real intentions were and to compare it with what they have told publicly.,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660119524577280
585,2022-04-28 12:49:40+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1519660116626321408
586,2022-04-28 12:49:38+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"5/ While both of the above statements might be true, it does not exclude the possibility that the founders have a particular ideology and it doesn‚Äôt go into any of the details.

4116,2022-01-17 16:16:12+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust. This is a tactic that Beanie is well aware of and frequently uses.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483110919148294156
4117,2022-01-17 16:10:45+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"57/ When Beanie recently started re-using an old Twitter account for his new fund at GM Capital, he clearly did not seem to have been aware of that fact that this account was suggesting followers to follow the Twitter accounts of all his previous ""scams"". BLASTcx was another one. https://t.co/KGLN5lT50v",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483109547573141507
4118,2022-01-17 16:06:32+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"56/ TPAY and TokenPay Suisse AG were transferred to RGT, and many people involved in the ""TPAY scam"" were already well aware of that. The latest Medium post by TokenPay (https://t.co/XNyNNoxwoZ) is that new updates can be followed via RGT and so we have come full circle. https://t.co/qcH7hxCMKM",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483108486011662336
4119,2022-01-17 15:49:05+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"55/ According to the website of Huntingdon (using the Wayback Machine which has proven to be still a very valuable tool), he was also an investor in InvestFeed, a website that is currently not accessible anymore as it is investigated by The Financial Commission. https://t.co/b2oa7OSZHQ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483104092822065156
4120,2022-01-17 15:49:03+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"54/ The domain name for Huntingdon Investment was only registered just before the ICO launch, so it only seems to be used to provide credibility to the claim that Beanie was only an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù instead of the mastermind behind it. The domain is currently available to register... https://t.co/jpNxPFGcat",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483104087088504835
4121,2022-01-17 15:46:35+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"53/ The investment vehicle that he used for TokenPay was Huntingdon Investment Corp, registered on the British Virgin Islands on the same address as TokenPay. The address is also included in the Panama papers. The whitepaper mentions the how critical this ""partner"" was. https://t.co/TF6TU1Mcck",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483103465064783872
4122,2022-01-17 15:46:34+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,52/ This should not come as a surprise as he recently admitted using 16 Twitter handles and provided proof of that... https://t.co/EHbyJl1GYP,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483103460530786304
4123,2022-01-17 15:20:19+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"51/ Beanie was already known to be using many different aliases in order to influence, deceive and manipulate people during his TV piracy business, and that pattern seems to have continued during his time with TokenPay. But certain apps show the name based on your phone number... https://t.co/aWtEDRq5A4",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483096856146104322
4124,2022-01-17 15:04:05+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name. It is obvious in whose possession those valuable domain names are or were in case they have been resold. The domains were listed on https://t.co/bpvWhH592q. https://t.co/dUgpCIuQqk",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483092769409273860
4125,2022-01-17 15:04:04+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,48/ The coins they used to buy these domains were those that were refunded after being illegally sold to US investors. https://t.co/gfSN4LXC26,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483092764199956486
4126,2022-01-17 14:54:47+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,47/ Also a TokenPay entity in Hong Kong was created (again behind a proxy) that was used to dump 2.5 million TPAY coins on the market in exchange for hundreds of valuable domain names that went to personal accounts. The value of the TPAY coin would never recover after this. https://t.co/4spkTiuvvh,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090428626980865
4127,2022-01-17 14:54:46+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,46/ A TokenPay entity in Switzerland was created (as usual behind a proxy) and stakes were bought into a real estate bank that didn‚Äôt make any profits. They also acquired 7% of a public company stock called Naked Brands (which has not been sold yet). https://t.co/ZLcPfM844W,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090423962914822
4128,2022-01-17 14:54:45+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,45/ Internal pump and dump schemes and very shady business deals and partnerships were suspected to have enabled a large percentage of funds to be siphoned off for personal gain while reducing the BTC value of the TPAY coin for its holders. https://t.co/9SkyygKEsQ,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090419491778560
4129,2022-01-17 14:54:44+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090415079337986
4130,2022-01-17 14:54:43+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"43/ One of the largest and most prominent crypto scams he has been involved in is the case of TokenPay (TPAY), whereby he pretended again to be an investor, but really was suspected to be acting as the CEO behind the screens. He wrote the WP foreword, see: https://t.co/Oe2utTitIz",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090411358990336
4131,2022-01-17 14:44:31+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"42/ Under his own name associated with his company ‚ÄúEquitable Research‚Äù, he also wrote for financial media such as The Street and Seeking Alpha, and then realized money could be made with cryptos/ICOs. https://t.co/JMbyWlL9XF",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483087844121927684
4132,2022-01-17 14:44:30+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"41/ He became active on Twitter trying to provide his analysis on mid cap stocks. His Twitter bio had the slogan ‚ÄúBuy Grief, Sell Hype‚Äù. What he is doing with NFTs now, he more or less used to do with stocks. Not everyone always agreed with his analyses... https://t.co/oRgsfQo0l2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483087839705407495
4133,2022-01-17 14:41:09+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"40/ Even though Beanie has often mentioned that he never had any social online presence, this was certainly not true. He used to have a Twitter account with over 12k followers, a Facebook account and a LinkedIn profile. https://t.co/CMpAyolbdj",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086999099740164
4134,2022-01-17 14:41:08+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"39/ This was not unexpected, as it was not uncommon for him to threaten unsatisfied customers that complained to release their personal details (knowing that they would get into trouble). An example of someone that was banned from his forum and Beanie releasing his personal data: https://t.co/lPgPf7pAzU",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086994704154624
4135,2022-01-17 14:41:07+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"38/ The case was however dismissed because Beanie allegedly made a deal and sold out all his thousands of paid customers, incl. admins/mods of his forum by handing over all their personal data to the authorities. They all faced criminal charges and were fined. https://t.co/WBPkeK2mvo",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086990585311235
4136,2022-01-17 14:31:05+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"37/ Both websites were however sued by DirecTV (also known as Dave, after the VP and Head of Signal Security David Baylor) and the legal court case documents can still be found online, see (1) https://t.co/geZhWGt2El, (2) https://t.co/RujiUsR5OI and (3) https://t.co/CoL45AHewD",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084464070832128
4137,2022-01-17 14:31:04+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"36/ Beanie would go on with his dubious practices as the owner (AKA ‚ÄúHU King‚Äù) of https://t.co/Qhzdy1JpH2 and co-owner of https://t.co/TfU4tn4OTr, and started to move their hosting servers from his native country Canada to central America, where he currently still resides. https://t.co/l16hgcRbmb",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084461721980933
4138,2022-01-17 14:31:03+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"35/ After many complaints and suspected DOS attacks against competitor websites, Beanie apparently came under investigation by Canadian and US enforcement authorities and https://t.co/6sxOk3Wfz0 was discontinued. https://t.co/jhBq3cAuoy",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084457053671427
4139,2022-01-17 14:31:02+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"34/ Even then he received so many complaints for scamming on forums, that people were warning for him. We show a screenshot of a forum thread with 14 pages of complaints, and one from another forum with a specific warning about him personally. https://t.co/ijYuOuC8aJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084451374673925
4140,2022-01-17 14:31:00+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"33/  The first traces of Beanie online were when he was active in the TV pirating business more than 20 years ago. As the owner of https://t.co/k6MXs6qgrI, he was selling devices designed for the surreptitious interception of satellite communications. https://t.co/LSAhVIexGN",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084445599027204
4141,2022-01-17 12:38:49+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"32/ So was this an isolated incident that Beanie was involved in? When diving into his past, this was only the tip of the iceberg and there is a pattern during his very dubious ‚Äúprofessional career‚Äù. We briefly provide a chronological overview.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056211390078980
4142,2022-01-17 12:38:48+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"31/ There was a Facebook group and website by unsatisfied customers of RGT. When Beanie understood that his identity was linked to RGT and that his name was mentioned on these websites, they paid these people off to take the websites down. This happened in the last two weeks. https://t.co/1cZMSdhVIY",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056207418085380
4143,2022-01-17 12:38:47+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,30/ They recently had a giveaway but the wallets that they mentioned as being the winners of that giveaway were made-up wallet addresses ‚Äì they don‚Äôt exist on the blockchain. https://t.co/6dO6ftTcFI,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056202074529795
4144,2022-01-17 12:38:46+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"29/ It is now clear why all the mint money went to Owlman and Beanie and why they all the time tried to push for an affiliate casino system. They didn‚Äôt only make money on the mint and royalties, but also on the casinos themselves.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056197573955592
4145,2022-01-17 12:38:45+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions ‚Äúcommunity first‚Äù, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056195489443843
4146,2022-01-17 12:38:44+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"27/ It is ironic that Beanie often mentions his dislike for low-effort copy pastas, when we have to conclude that Monkey Bet DAO and Baboon Bet (1000 ETH mint in total) was nothing more than just that: a copy pasta of RGT‚Äôs earlier products. https://t.co/YHhDc8nukM",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056191949492225
4147,2022-01-17 12:38:42+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"26/ The company RGT itself is registered in Panama, with an officer of an offshore entity who is also mentioned in the Panama papers. That will become a recurrent pattern: Beanie generally always hides behind someone else (or a proxy). https://t.co/nGBwCyo7mp",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056184282259459
4148,2022-01-17 12:19:51+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"25/ It was probably meant to create the illusion that CryptoBet or ChimpBet have a proper gambling license, because when we checked the status, it seems to be a sub-license of another company, of which there is no trace. The address is associated with another (gambling) company. https://t.co/MLVBeX5h6V",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051439291355141
4149,2022-01-17 12:19:49+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"24/ When we checked the status of Corporation Registration Number associated with RGT, it shows that registration was discontinued on 15 April 2020, even though the casinos have been operational after that and still are to this date. https://t.co/T4MNToXQD6",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051430856507397
4150,2022-01-17 12:19:47+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"23/ On different forums, TrustPilot, and Reddit, there are many complaints about CryptoBet. In particular it is frequently mentioned that once you win a jackpot in their casinos, they flag your account as ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù (without explanation) and you are not able to withdraw anything https://t.co/Md5V5whiXs",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051423743066119
4151,2022-01-17 12:19:45+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"22/ TokenPay was transferred to RGT, and it was easy to find out that the same person behind CBET and TokenPay was also the person behind RGT. In fact, before he used the name Beanie, he used the name EC on Discord, which corresponds to one of his many TokenPay twitter handles. https://t.co/1eTndL01k3",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051414532280320
4152,2022-01-17 12:19:44+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"21/ When typing in the real name of Owlman into OS, an ENS domain showed up attached to an account (0x08ac0605d7dca266735e9686dd90285b9e4952f0) with an interesting history. It was the deployer of CBET, a ‚Äúscam token‚Äù, associated with a variety of ‚Äúscam projects‚Äù, incl. TokenPay. https://t.co/HD29IBYdHe",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051407703949314
4153,2022-01-17 12:19:42+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"20/ According to his LinkedIn profile, Owlman is IRL the General Manager of RGT, and even though Beanie has mentioned multiple times that he is a dev, he is not. https://t.co/QLz2xBwUQd",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051401647472643
4154,2022-01-17 12:19:40+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"19/ There is a CryptoBet video on YouTube that features a person that has exactly the same voice as the MBD project lead Owlman (Twitter handle: Owlman1of1), and during one of the MB Twitter Spaces Beanie mentioned his first name, which did indeed match. https://t.co/fAgBJELle4",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051390935379971
4155,2022-01-17 12:19:37+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"18/ When ChimpBet was launched, the publicly announced director of ChimpBet was directly identified as a Sales Director of RGT and people also noticed a resemblance with another RGT project called https://t.co/013tPQirQR. https://t.co/J57ZvsxYua",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051380101234691
4156,2022-01-17 12:19:35+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"17/ The so called ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051372090175497
4157,2022-01-17 12:19:33+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"16/ Many OG holders asking critical questions about the project were banned from the Discord. And when Beanie was asked whether he knew RGT, he denied ever having heard of it (see screenshots). But, in actual fact, it turns out he is the owner of RGT. https://t.co/rjhvuK8fyC",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051363563098113
4158,2022-01-17 12:19:31+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,15/ People in the Monkey Bet DAO Discord already had noticed that the name RGT (Royal Gaming Technology) was mentioned in the T&amp;Cs of various MBD websites and the Company Registration number and slot designs were identical to the ones from RGT. https://t.co/oZ0Udl7tll,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051355229114373
4159,2022-01-17 12:19:29+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"14/ Before answering that question, we first explain how we were able to discover his identity. We have to go back to a project called Monkey Bet DAO by ‚ÄúInvariant Labs‚Äù (IL) that Beanie says he invested a ""very small"" amount in. That could not be further from the truth. https://t.co/OWDhS4kPk1",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051346148433921
4160,2022-01-17 12:19:27+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,13/ Beanie describes himself in one of his online profiles attached to his real name as ‚Äúabsent of a strong work ethic‚Äù and as someone ‚Äúwho takes pride in the fact that he has never had a real job in his life‚Äù. So how was he able to become so ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù? https://t.co/9KYFWDzjT9,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051340309966854
4161,2022-01-17 12:19:26+00:00,https://twitter.com/NFTethics,"12/ For those that only believe things when they hear it (most won't have ever seen him, but will recognize his voice), we provide hereby a short part of a video in which you can hear his voice.
