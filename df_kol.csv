22177,"25/ If you are ever caught lying, just say that you have been experimenting a bit with the truth, which to a certain extent can be regarded as the true essence of art.

22178,"24/ Linda Xie is very well connected in the NFT space, is a personal investor in OpenSea, a ""close friend of a16z‚Äù (in a16z‚Äôs own words).

22179,"23/ Scalar Capital is also an investor in Dfinity, which is the former employer of Whizwang (Elizabeth Yang), and Twitter shows that the 2 know each other.

22180,"22/ It makes it even more shameless to see that in Scalar Capital‚Äôs pitch deck, they explicitly mention that they bought 0x at $0.048. Fun fact: Coinbase just announced 0x Labs as their NFT partner and the price of ZRX skyrocketed. https://t.co/l5KMkEr67F",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534302791516161,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,79,,4
22181,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534295719923712,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,76,,4
22182,"20/ The 2 Scalar Capital founders were heavily involved in developing Coinbase‚Äôs listing procedures along with an engineer (Maksim Stepanenko), who was an advisor to Scalar. The sudden manner in which Coinbase listed 0x (price climbed up 17% within an hour) attracted suspicions. https://t.co/eaposggJkZ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1526534290225434624,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,67,,3
22183,19/ Scalar Capital claimed that it provides ‚Äúasymmetric info‚Äù and ‚Äúearly access to projects‚Äù to its partners.

22184,"18/ Scalar‚Äôs founders invested in 0x‚Äôs public token sale before Coinbase listed it.

38108,52/ This should not come as a surprise as he recently admitted using 16 Twitter handles and provided proof of that... https://t.co/EHbyJl1GYP,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483103460530786304,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,225,,9
38109,"51/ Beanie was already known to be using many different aliases in order to influence, deceive and manipulate people during his TV piracy business, and that pattern seems to have continued during his time with TokenPay. But certain apps show the name based on your phone number... https://t.co/aWtEDRq5A4",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483096856146104322,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,175,,8
38110,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name. It is obvious in whose possession those valuable domain names are or were in case they have been resold. The domains were listed on https://t.co/bpvWhH592q. https://t.co/dUgpCIuQqk",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483092769409273860,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,151,,3
38111,48/ The coins they used to buy these domains were those that were refunded after being illegally sold to US investors. https://t.co/gfSN4LXC26,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483092764199956486,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,140,,3
38112,47/ Also a TokenPay entity in Hong Kong was created (again behind a proxy) that was used to dump 2.5 million TPAY coins on the market in exchange for hundreds of valuable domain names that went to personal accounts. The value of the TPAY coin would never recover after this. https://t.co/4spkTiuvvh,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090428626980865,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,145,,5
38113,46/ A TokenPay entity in Switzerland was created (as usual behind a proxy) and stakes were bought into a real estate bank that didn‚Äôt make any profits. They also acquired 7% of a public company stock called Naked Brands (which has not been sold yet). https://t.co/ZLcPfM844W,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090423962914822,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,141,,4
38114,45/ Internal pump and dump schemes and very shady business deals and partnerships were suspected to have enabled a large percentage of funds to be siphoned off for personal gain while reducing the BTC value of the TPAY coin for its holders. https://t.co/9SkyygKEsQ,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090419491778560,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,164,,4
38115,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090415079337986,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,220,,20
38116,"43/ One of the largest and most prominent crypto scams he has been involved in is the case of TokenPay (TPAY), whereby he pretended again to be an investor, but really was suspected to be acting as the CEO behind the screens. He wrote the WP foreword, see: https://t.co/Oe2utTitIz",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483090411358990336,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,192,,5
38117,"42/ Under his own name associated with his company ‚ÄúEquitable Research‚Äù, he also wrote for financial media such as The Street and Seeking Alpha, and then realized money could be made with cryptos/ICOs. https://t.co/JMbyWlL9XF",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483087844121927684,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,163,,4
38118,"41/ He became active on Twitter trying to provide his analysis on mid cap stocks. His Twitter bio had the slogan ‚ÄúBuy Grief, Sell Hype‚Äù. What he is doing with NFTs now, he more or less used to do with stocks. Not everyone always agreed with his analyses... https://t.co/oRgsfQo0l2",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483087839705407495,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,181,,8
38119,"40/ Even though Beanie has often mentioned that he never had any social online presence, this was certainly not true. He used to have a Twitter account with over 12k followers, a Facebook account and a LinkedIn profile. https://t.co/CMpAyolbdj",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086999099740164,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,174,,8
38120,"39/ This was not unexpected, as it was not uncommon for him to threaten unsatisfied customers that complained to release their personal details (knowing that they would get into trouble). An example of someone that was banned from his forum and Beanie releasing his personal data: https://t.co/lPgPf7pAzU",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086994704154624,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,179,,7
38121,"38/ The case was however dismissed because Beanie allegedly made a deal and sold out all his thousands of paid customers, incl. admins/mods of his forum by handing over all their personal data to the authorities. They all faced criminal charges and were fined. https://t.co/WBPkeK2mvo",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483086990585311235,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,252,,21
38122,"37/ Both websites were however sued by DirecTV (also known as Dave, after the VP and Head of Signal Security David Baylor) and the legal court case documents can still be found online, see (1) https://t.co/geZhWGt2El, (2) https://t.co/RujiUsR5OI and (3) https://t.co/CoL45AHewD",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084464070832128,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,152,,5
38123,"36/ Beanie would go on with his dubious practices as the owner (AKA ‚ÄúHU King‚Äù) of https://t.co/Qhzdy1JpH2 and co-owner of https://t.co/TfU4tn4OTr, and started to move their hosting servers from his native country Canada to central America, where he currently still resides. https://t.co/l16hgcRbmb",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084461721980933,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,151,,5
38124,"35/ After many complaints and suspected DOS attacks against competitor websites, Beanie apparently came under investigation by Canadian and US enforcement authorities and https://t.co/6sxOk3Wfz0 was discontinued. https://t.co/jhBq3cAuoy",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084457053671427,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,200,,9
38125,"34/ Even then he received so many complaints for scamming on forums, that people were warning for him. We show a screenshot of a forum thread with 14 pages of complaints, and one from another forum with a specific warning about him personally. https://t.co/ijYuOuC8aJ",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084451374673925,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,198,,7
38126,"33/  The first traces of Beanie online were when he was active in the TV pirating business more than 20 years ago. As the owner of https://t.co/k6MXs6qgrI, he was selling devices designed for the surreptitious interception of satellite communications. https://t.co/LSAhVIexGN",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483084445599027204,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,214,,14
38127,"32/ So was this an isolated incident that Beanie was involved in? When diving into his past, this was only the tip of the iceberg and there is a pattern during his very dubious ‚Äúprofessional career‚Äù. We briefly provide a chronological overview.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056211390078980,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,213,,4
38128,"31/ There was a Facebook group and website by unsatisfied customers of RGT. When Beanie understood that his identity was linked to RGT and that his name was mentioned on these websites, they paid these people off to take the websites down. This happened in the last two weeks. https://t.co/1cZMSdhVIY",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056207418085380,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,475,,28
38129,30/ They recently had a giveaway but the wallets that they mentioned as being the winners of that giveaway were made-up wallet addresses ‚Äì they don‚Äôt exist on the blockchain. https://t.co/6dO6ftTcFI,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056202074529795,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,701,,55
38130,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions ‚Äúcommunity first‚Äù, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all.",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056195489443843,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,401,,17
38131,"27/ It is ironic that Beanie often mentions his dislike for low-effort copy pastas, when we have to conclude that Monkey Bet DAO and Baboon Bet (1000 ETH mint in total) was nothing more than just that: a copy pasta of RGT‚Äôs earlier products. https://t.co/YHhDc8nukM",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056191949492225,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,356,,23
38132,"26/ The company RGT itself is registered in Panama, with an officer of an offshore entity who is also mentioned in the Panama papers. That will become a recurrent pattern: Beanie generally always hides behind someone else (or a proxy). https://t.co/nGBwCyo7mp",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483056184282259459,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,318,,11
38133,"25/ It was probably meant to create the illusion that CryptoBet or ChimpBet have a proper gambling license, because when we checked the status, it seems to be a sub-license of another company, of which there is no trace. The address is associated with another (gambling) company. https://t.co/MLVBeX5h6V",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051439291355141,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,286,,12
38134,"24/ When we checked the status of Corporation Registration Number associated with RGT, it shows that registration was discontinued on 15 April 2020, even though the casinos have been operational after that and still are to this date. https://t.co/T4MNToXQD6",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051430856507397,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,285,,6
38135,"23/ On different forums, TrustPilot, and Reddit, there are many complaints about CryptoBet. In particular it is frequently mentioned that once you win a jackpot in their casinos, they flag your account as ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù (without explanation) and you are not able to withdraw anything https://t.co/Md5V5whiXs",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051423743066119,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,311,,11
38136,"22/ TokenPay was transferred to RGT, and it was easy to find out that the same person behind CBET and TokenPay was also the person behind RGT. In fact, before he used the name Beanie, he used the name EC on Discord, which corresponds to one of his many TokenPay twitter handles. https://t.co/1eTndL01k3",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051414532280320,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,328,,13
38137,"21/ When typing in the real name of Owlman into OS, an ENS domain showed up attached to an account (0x08ac0605d7dca266735e9686dd90285b9e4952f0) with an interesting history. It was the deployer of CBET, a ‚Äúscam token‚Äù, associated with a variety of ‚Äúscam projects‚Äù, incl. TokenPay. https://t.co/HD29IBYdHe",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051407703949314,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,375,,17
38138,"20/ According to his LinkedIn profile, Owlman is IRL the General Manager of RGT, and even though Beanie has mentioned multiple times that he is a dev, he is not. https://t.co/QLz2xBwUQd",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051401647472643,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,267,,7
38139,"19/ There is a CryptoBet video on YouTube that features a person that has exactly the same voice as the MBD project lead Owlman (Twitter handle: Owlman1of1), and during one of the MB Twitter Spaces Beanie mentioned his first name, which did indeed match. https://t.co/fAgBJELle4",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051390935379971,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,259,,7
38140,"18/ When ChimpBet was launched, the publicly announced director of ChimpBet was directly identified as a Sales Director of RGT and people also noticed a resemblance with another RGT project called https://t.co/013tPQirQR. https://t.co/J57ZvsxYua",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051380101234691,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,288,,10
38141,"17/ The so called ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051372090175497,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,346,,9
38142,"16/ Many OG holders asking critical questions about the project were banned from the Discord. And when Beanie was asked whether he knew RGT, he denied ever having heard of it (see screenshots). But, in actual fact, it turns out he is the owner of RGT. https://t.co/rjhvuK8fyC",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051363563098113,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,324,,12
38143,15/ People in the Monkey Bet DAO Discord already had noticed that the name RGT (Royal Gaming Technology) was mentioned in the T&amp;Cs of various MBD websites and the Company Registration number and slot designs were identical to the ones from RGT. https://t.co/oZ0Udl7tll,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051355229114373,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,282,,12
38144,"14/ Before answering that question, we first explain how we were able to discover his identity. We have to go back to a project called Monkey Bet DAO by ‚ÄúInvariant Labs‚Äù (IL) that Beanie says he invested a ""very small"" amount in. That could not be further from the truth. https://t.co/OWDhS4kPk1",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051346148433921,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,310,,16
38145,13/ Beanie describes himself in one of his online profiles attached to his real name as ‚Äúabsent of a strong work ethic‚Äù and as someone ‚Äúwho takes pride in the fact that he has never had a real job in his life‚Äù. So how was he able to become so ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù? https://t.co/9KYFWDzjT9,https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051340309966854,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,403,,28
38146,"12/ For those that only believe things when they hear it (most won't have ever seen him, but will recognize his voice), we provide hereby a short part of a video in which you can hear his voice. He is not visible, because we cut it in such a way that no one is recognizable. https://t.co/bLZNVrYTre",https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1483051333808795648,NFTethics,data\NFT ethics.csv,80846,307,,10
