4,ethical,"1/ In this thread we will summarize what we have tried to achieve in the past weeks and show the “bigger ethical picture” of the NFT space. We are at a crossroad and if we don’t take the right direction, we might well hit a dead end."
4,ethical,"24/ Are there no good people? Of course, there are. The majority is good, but as we already mentioned before this space favors the least ethical and most immoral persons, and they are productive and dominant in this space. And it influences others to behave unethically as well."
4,ethical,5/ It’s equally interesting however to look at the seemingly “good” or “reputable” people/organizations and how they have behaved. Were they able to behave ethically with all the power that they have? Were they better than Web2’s BigTech?
4,ethical,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going.

https://t.co/ElH2kNiN7t"
6,rug,"7/ One of these scams is @MissUniverseNFt and it was not mentioned on the overview in the orginal thread. This was a project that @NFT heavily promoted, even with AMA’s with the “founder”, but it was a rug and the website of the Miss Universe has been deleted. https://t.co/uFbwMfDy3w"

6,look,"@Mladek_eth I feel we’re currently representing a depressing reflection of the traditional art world in terms of diversity if we look at the top sales etc, but as my good friend @mecdot says , the paint isn’t dry, the concrete isn’t set, we still have chance to change it."

6,look,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We are not saying that, but we do hope that more experts like you do a deep dive into all those similarly looking and advertised projects that minted in the past week and are about to mint that are all connected. Could potentially be the biggest ""heist"" in NFT history."

6,like,"One of the problems is that all mint money for NFT projects goes straight to the founders without any effort and only based on promises and hype. It's difficult to assess whether a project is legitimate and we like the idea of performance based contracts:

https://t.co/qSBnqwhdLY"
6,like,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
6,like,"In some way it's unnecessary to also mention the project FashionApe, but because it's minting this week and just for the avoidance of doubt - it's all the same scam over and over again (just like MetaTribes) https://t.co/EK5eFypES5 https://t.co/ksZ1fYcH1m"
6,like,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
6,project,"2/ That project is also minting today. All these individuals generally DM us on mint day or the day before to warn us that they think the project is a scam given their extensive experiences in the Discord. It remains very difficult to check if that is always the case, because..."
6,project,"We simply have to all agree that we don’t mint any project with mint prices &gt;0.1 (ideally lower). It will disincentive scammers to go for cash grabs, will keep more liquidity in the NFT/ETH ecosystem and will create more innovation in this space (e.g. performance-based contracts)"
6,project,"2/ People feel especially betrayed by the fact that only 30 ETH was left in the community fund for further development, while 90 ETH in total seemed to have been paid to some of the moderators. The founders seem to have left the project with more than 1700 ETH."
6,project,"8/ He also claims that they are using a lot of the funds for traveling. They always travel with the whole team (20+ people) together each week, which is a bit ironic for a project that claims to conquer the metaverse. Maybe first invent a metamansion to reduce your expenses."
6,project,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.

9,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
9,transparent,"It takes a lot to build an #NFTproject. Most of it happens behind the scenes.

When TUS was born 4 weeks ago, we made a conscious decision to build in public and be transparent.

Introducing our🤠WEEKLY ROUND-UP🤠👇🏻🧵

#communitybuilding #queerlednft #womenincrypto #nfts"
9,transparent,"Artists being able to verify the origins of their work in a transparent way, and buyers being able to see that verification - Yey"
9,platform,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
9,platform,"CONTROL YOUR OWN COMMUNITY 
🔶Creators are in-charge of their communities as opposed to the platform
🔶Creators can set their own rules &amp; create their own culture within their circles
#TrustVibes is the Creator #Ecosystem, Built for Tomorrow. $TRUST https://t.co/p5R8F8lS7q 🔥 https://t.co/RyKcwrOmnx"
9,platform,Ok so transparency is good. Providing platform to someone to use sexist and ableist slurs ain’t it. Tuning out.
9,platform,"1/ A quick update on MontanaBlack who in actual fact seems to have &gt;20 million followers on all kinds of platforms. The story shows how many of these scam rings operate. There is always someone in the background doing the ""dirty"" work functioning as the intermediary and fall guy. https://t.co/SVtpeby664"
9,platform,"1/ An interesting story on Squiggles and how one of the largest German social media influencers (&gt;8 million followers across all platforms) was involved. He just ""apologized"" for promoting this scam by three voice tweets. Writing it would probably do more reputational damage. https://t.co/25yQK8cUJf"

10,price,"For those that are new. The floor price normally goes up after minting, and continues to remain above minting price until the reveal. After that it can quickly go down below mint price. That's why many ""scam projects"" delay the reveal. HypeBears was able to get &gt;$1M today via OS."
10,price,"PixelSaurus is an #NFT collection for the whole family to collect. Our fun, non-generative designs are diverse and inclusive and our 2 collections are priced from just 0.02 &amp; 0.03 ETH, to make them accessible. We’re also verified on @opensea! #NFTs 

🦕🦖 https://t.co/9gDe9ggcs5 https://t.co/bNzyyIwtJc"
10,price,"We said it before, but for people new(ish) to the space, there is simply no justification to ask millions upfront by undoxxed, unproven teams with nothing than some fancy JPEGs and fake influencers promoting it.

Mint price for many past projects was &lt;0.1

https://t.co/qVE9dmGOSk"
10,price,"1/ We received quite a lot of requests to look at @metamansionsnft, which is minting later this week. The mint price alone (0.88 ETH) is already a red flag, but there are many more. They are doing a “giveaway” of 888 ETH (10% of the mint profit) but only when it sells out AND…"
10,price,"The behavior of @elonmusk is similar to many Web3 influencers. First FUDing Twitter by suggesting things are wrong and he might create a new social media platform. He creates leverage &amp; buys the dip. Stock price goes up &amp; he can use the platform to shill.
https://t.co/S480vCYNk8"
10,believe,4/ We have heard various people say that this is simply the “dark side of decentralization” and it’s just “part of the game”. But we believe that might well be a logical fallacy. Let’s give some examples.
10,believe,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
10,believe,"17/ The so called “big lie” is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6"
10,believe,1/ We are going to drop a nuclear bomb on @MetaMansionsNFT and this one is pretty wild. We have heard via a reliable source that the entire team went to Dubai to get UAE citizenship and avoid Canadian income tax. We believe this allegation to be credible. Why?
10,believe,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
10,mint,"2/ Via the OpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received “NFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investments”. We confirmed that these are genuine (seed) investors. https://t.co/phDWGuGilG"

10,mint,"2/ When will the risks be shifted from the holders/minters to the founders? When will ""free mints"" become the norm, and the founders will have to work in order to get the sales royalties coming in? This is a constant liquidity drain and not sustainable for the NFT ecosystem."
10,mint,"We simply have to all agree that we don’t mint any project with mint prices &gt;0.1 (ideally lower). It will disincentive scammers to go for cash grabs, will keep more liquidity in the NFT/ETH ecosystem and will create more innovation in this space (e.g. performance-based contracts)"
10,mint,"The project @DeluxeGoat is 99.9% a scam (also minting today). Founders have 0 and 1 post on IG. They paid for Google ads, and one of the founders could well be the same one as the one from ""Immortal Apes"" as he writes gas both times in an unusual (and incorrect) way. Gass what? https://t.co/RamDHzBDxe"
10,invest,"We wonder if the two @LooksRareNFT founders, Guts and @ZoddLooksRare, would be willing to give some clarification on why they seem to use a Chinese proxy for their company filings in the UK and Canada. And whether all the influencer investors in LooksRare know their identities. https://t.co/IxUePOH66f"
10,invest,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr
10,invest,2/ In MontanaBlack's case that is the below person with &gt;150k followers on Twitter. This whole thread is courtesy to @shinraton who reported this in German. He also shared the DM's of this person who is looking for projects that he and MontanaBlack can invest in (see screenshots) https://t.co/0VRoUUAJlm
10,invest,"The NFT space basically consists of two worlds: 

1. Experienced investors that use Twitter/reputable contacts for their info. 
2. Inexperienced naifs that get their info from paid shills at Instagram.

They never talk about or even mention the same projects."
10,invest,"18/ On the list is also Jason Galvanis, CEO of CAMEO, a company that a16z seems to have missed out on but did include in their marketplace 100. Snoop Dogg (real name: Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.) backs this venture and he is also an investor in Yuga Labs. https://t.co/josXgmVOiu"

10,project,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.

https://t.co/22ZIUxgO4H https://t.co/BFMwANNzx7"
10,project,"2/ It remains strange to us that many that are planning to spend 0.5 ETH on any project, don’t seem to do any research at all. If someone on the street asks you to give him/her $1300 USD as an investment into something, wouldn’t you do any proper due diligence?"
10,project,"If you are new to the NFT space, our advice would be not to mint ANY project for the coming 2 weeks. We have indications that the same scam team created many projects each day, and they only have a limited time window before they are found out. That's why they delay the ""reveal""."

10,transparency,"23/ Scalar Capital is also an investor in Dfinity, which is the former employer of Whizwang (Elizabeth Yang), and Twitter shows that the 2 know each other.

11,nft,"1/ We received quite a lot of requests to look at @metamansionsnft, which is minting later this week. The mint price alone (0.88 ETH) is already a red flag, but there are many more. They are doing a “giveaway” of 888 ETH (10% of the mint profit) but only when it sells out AND…"
11,team,"15/ Another Yuga Labs investor is Diplo (DJ Thomas Wesley Pentz), who recently teamed up with Royal, a venture by Justin Blau (also an investor in Yuga Labs), which recently raised $55 million by a16z. https://t.co/lgq4doqoLb"
11,team,"17/ The so called “big lie” is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6"
11,team,4/4 An example is a team member of a project minting tomorrow using a Twitter account from an attorney (who confirmed he was locked out of his account). 99.99% of the 6400 tweets have no relationship with NFTs. Another example is of an actress whose account now has been restored. https://t.co/f4vpRnYEVZ
11,team,"We checked the SuperFatApes (you just can't make it up) and we can confirm that we found the 4 team members on LinkedIn using their exact names: Tony Narcoleptic, Jack Unhealthy, Ewann Fearful &amp; Willy Clumsy. Sometimes projects positively surprise us. In an ironic way of course. https://t.co/IWQpeq5JQi"
11,team,"Just a quick retweet from the same group that created the Squiggles document. They also claim that @YogiesNFT that is minting in a couple of hours is a project/rug by the Squiggles team and have compiled a 171 document with proof/evidence.

12,come,6/ We will update this thread further when more information becomes available. In the meantime we hope that all people involved are enjoying their cereal breakfast this morning!
12,come,"12/ There can be a cultural disconnect. In Europe, everyone who has one failed business is basically not taken seriously anymore, while that is the complete opposite in the US. You have to have a couple of failures to be taken seriously and you can even become US president."
12,come,"10/ If this issue is not soon being taken care of, it will only get worse and these nefarious actors only get more influence and become more intertwined with the NFT ecosystem. And one day you wake up and realize Big Tech was not even that bad."
12,come,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
12,year,14/ There is one Twitter source that predates BAYC by more than a year and another source from an academic William Allchorn who recently wrote a book “Moving beyond Islamist Extremism”. We have provided their explanations in the screenshots below. https://t.co/YAmMwtVbqP
12,year,"17/ But it gets worse: The Block posted an article a couple of years ago about the connection between Coinbase, 0x Labs and Scalar Capital. They have removed that article, maybe because Mike Dudas now has his own fund backed by a16z. https://t.co/y3mXpKseMJ"
12,year,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"

12,change,4/ Did you know that technically a16z is not a VC anymore? They changed a couple of years ago to a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA).

12,change,"4/ Initially he admitted that he didn't have any experience with crypto, but later he suddenly changed that story to suggest he has 4 years of crypto experience.

12,project,"Dear @wizardofsoho - I see that you are tweeting a lot about others people's scams, but what about your own scammy/shady projects and behavior? Do you think that your employer or the more than 1.5 million people for which they manage pensions/health benefits would be impressed?"
12,project,"7/ Fun fact 1 – even Serena Williams’ coach of 10 years, Patrick Mouratoglou, is now an NFT/Crypto expert. He raised over a million with a project that he seems to have rugged, but he will come back in 2023 with a new coin. We can’t wait for this crypto guru to change the world. https://t.co/tMnt659PKx"
12,project,"We already mentioned earlier that there is a thriving business in selling/buying (verified) Twitter accounts with many followers. It's also very easy to buy (fake) followers to give the impression that there is demand for certain projects.

12,project,"We need a non-profit advertising service that applies some level of due-diligence on the projects it promotes with standardised and transparent fees.

https://t.co/ElH2kNiN7t"
12,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."

I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop.

13,help,"@0xQuit Many people are often not able to predict in advance which projects are ""going to help us build"", certainly not when the founders are undoxxed. Less or no money upfront means less incentive to scam, and almost no liquidity drain. Now it's 0% risk for founders, 100% for holders."

21,investment,The business model of VCs is that the best investment in a successful fund/venture equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund/ventures combined. It’s the same with NFTs and this Web3 model is now brought into the lives of ordinary people. The implications are far-reaching.

23,buy,"The Web3/NFT space can be regarded as a microcosm of the VC world based on the right connections, buying low &amp; selling high, over-hyping and lots of phony philanthropy &amp; fake positivity. We will soon shine a light on all the VCs/individuals involved in pushing this space forward."
23,buy,"Imagine a scenario of huge consolidation where 1 successful/rich NFT project buys up lots of other promising and undervalued NFT projects and then, after a year, decides to sell it all to Meta/Facebook, Microsoft or any VC. From Web 3.0 to REKT 4.0. Welcome to The Metaverse 19.84"
23,buy,"2/ They would either reach out to celebrities or celebrities would contact them, so if you have been rugged, know that @jf_nft/@0xAA_NFT were responsible. They allegedly told insiders not to buy what they posted at @NFT IG because they knew they were rugs.
https://t.co/0wtvrvj7E2"
23,buy,"Elon Musk wanting to buy Twitter fits into the more common trend of billionaires wanting to buy clout via media companies: Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, Changpeng Zhao (Binance) ""invested"" $200 million in Forbes. Not the ""truth"" matters, but how many you can ""influence""."
23,buy,"24/ Also remember that if you ever see a tweet from @jf_nft in which he asks which NFT to buy, he is likely buying it with your money that he gained via all kinds of dodgy scams. This whole space is filled with charlatans, and many are high profile names that operate in networks."

24,collection,@pixelbot24 Fair point. :) These are actual real names of NFT collections. And we do have all the names of the people behind these rugs.
24,collection,"With @MuriNFT being a legitimate collection by @haustwts, it shows that once a project does well and reputable, it immediately creates many copycats that try to benefit from a particular brand or its success. We have seen this with (Bored) Apes, Wolf Game, etc, etc."
24,community,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"

24,community,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as “learning experiences”) and trust the process (don’t ask any questions, but “trust us”). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN"
24,community,"13/ This is a project with artists that have the right connections, but have not necessarily shown to have a track record in the NFT space, and the roadmap is also very vague, or even non existent. It will all be soon revealed and also will depend on what the community wants. https://t.co/DY47Kt7rJX"

24,project,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico’s Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"
24,project,"@OttoSuwenNFT It was indeed a conservative estimation. It could well be even above 95%. These scammers are basically factories that churn out project after project - just mindless JPEGs, without any vision/roadmap. Only fake/corrupt influencers behind them who are willing to promote this stuff"
24,project,"Many people that are socially or financially invested in a project or person, seem to turn a blind eye to any ethical issues regarding that project or person. They measure morality in dollars or degree of loyalty/friendship. In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."

25,team,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."

25,member,8/ Why would anyone want to be(come) part of a project where a significant number of members are scamming others? And why would Yuga Labs or Larva Labs want their reputation to be put at risk by a (still) very small minority?
25,member,"3/ Some names are very obvious: @farokh and his @rugradio friends @osf_nft, @greatmando_nft (via the canaryvault wallet) and @belikewater893. It explains the heated discussion between OSF and @Pranksy, and also why Farokh hosted the meeting with the Yuga board members. https://t.co/rkpLh3UIhN"

A project called @ApeDoods is minting today (total scam with fake/corrupt influencers) and many others are minting soon. Identify the obvious scams and cash grabs.

25,project,"1/ We have a couple of quick observations about the project @theshifters_ (90k Discord members), which will soon start minting. We were informed by multiple persons that tried to ask some questions that they were banned/blocked, so maybe it helps if we clarify their position."
25,project,"The NFT space basically consists of two worlds: 

1. Experienced investors that use Twitter/reputable contacts for their info. 
2. Inexperienced naifs that get their info from paid shills at Instagram.

They never talk about or even mention the same projects."
25,project,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"

25,community,"What happens to BAYC if all 10k Bored Apes have been bought by (bored) celebrities? They all try to become part of an exciting new community, but will gradually realize that it’s the same community that they are already part of. Good thing you can't photoshop the blockchain."
25,community,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.

27,make,"@NFTherder We specifically mentioned that people NEW to the NFT space shouldn't mint any project, because they won't be able to make a proper distinction between legit and scam projects. If they would do that, it would harm the NFT space far more long-term than our short term warning."
27,make,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let’s hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don’t have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else.

28,ago,"We were away for some days, but when we wrote the below message a couple of weeks ago, it was meant to be a warning for what we are currently seeing in the crypto/NFT/Web3 space. If you know the people/VCs involved, it shouldn't really come as a surprise.

https://t.co/Uh3Lcqu7Co"
28,ago,4/ Did you know that technically a16z is not a VC anymore? They changed a couple of years ago to a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). Little wonder the powerful VC lobby group the NVCA has been talking to the SEC into changing its definition of what constitutes a VC firm. https://t.co/aI9DAmhl00
28,ago,"63/ He also revealed to have run the largest hacker IRC, that he moved out of Canada more than 22 years ago for tax reasons, and that he has 30 years of professional trolling. https://t.co/xARwEx00Js"
28,ago,"Dear @LesleySilverman, as the Head of Digital Assets at UTA and formally representing Larva Labs' IP, did you think it was appropriate for you to purchase 2 Meebits 9 days ago? What does @unitedtalent think about employees that use insider information to gain an unfair advantage? https://t.co/LPUxcInUmK"
28,ago,"1/ Sometimes there are brilliant individuals out there who really take the time and effort to check connections between wallets and projects. Already 2 months ago, someone created the below chart and dropped it in the Ancient Cats Club Discord after it was rugged. https://t.co/jU3Xmgafxa"
28,say,"Many prominent people active in the NFT space who frequently say “WAGMI” and “Care for the community”, really mean: we need everyone to believe this so that they fill up the liquidity pool that I want to drain. 

They claim to like decentralization, but only for selfish purposes."
28,say,1/ A quick thread about the importance and current lack of ethics in the NFT space. We have noticed that a lot of the same persons are involved in multiple rugs. It’s probably even fair to say that there is a very small cartel of influential players that are serial ruggers.
28,say,"4/ As usual it starts by saying that it’s all lies, and that he has done many good things for the NFT space, and even spent $250k+ supporting ""unknown emerging"" 1/1 NFT artists from ""underdeveloped countries"". The phony philanthropy always speak volumes. https://t.co/X5IHK2CLML https://t.co/0hhKUGdg2W"
28,say,"We thought that the irony was obvious, but around 50% of the people didn't get it looking at the comments.

We meant to say: don't mint this stuff. They are not on LinkedIn.

If you don't get obvious irony, how can you see through not so obvious scams?

https://t.co/bRk1kqsWUJ"
28,say,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F
28,right,"We knew his identity and ""track record"" (as far as you can speak of that when you are 19/20 years old) already for quite a while, but had hoped that he (and his father) would have made the right decision...

https://t.co/INEvVHLab1"
28,right,"2/ The CEO of MoonPay, @isotowright, gave an interview with @theblock__, but some of the questions were not (properly) answered, so we would like to ask these questions again. The article can be found here (and we will refer to it in the tweets below): https://t.co/NIsofaeOtN"
28,right,"The Web3/NFT space can be regarded as a microcosm of the VC world based on the right connections, buying low &amp; selling high, over-hyping and lots of phony philanthropy &amp; fake positivity. We will soon shine a light on all the VCs/individuals involved in pushing this space forward."
28,right,11/ We called out MontanaBlack with his &gt;20M followers and his right-hand man. The latter deleted or changed his Twitter account immediately afterwards. https://t.co/JkUIiPooOV
28,right,"16/ We stumbled upon 4chan threads from 2014 &amp; 2016 that mentioned the term “Kali Yuga” and a French far right politician tweeted about it in 2015. In July 2019, a Telegram group called the ""Kali Yuga Surfing Club"" opened, featuring alt-right/Nazi-centric memes. https://t.co/muPNRGbJqY"

28,thing,"17/ Gargamel mentioned in an interview that they ""knew all about what this world was"", things are not ""just random"" which can also be concluded from the complicated puzzle that BAYC posted that ultimately could only be deciphered by a team of professionals https://t.co/rtp0fdAY6t https://t.co/oYjLHfDYty"
28,thing,"25/ It starts to become a space created by unethical people for unethical people. We have many powerful/unethical enemies, but we have even more powerless/ethical friends. We have used this account to protect that latter category against the former. Nothing more and nothing less."
28,thing,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.
28,thing,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
28,money,17/ You don’t have to be a genius to understand that a lot of that dirty money has been shifted to crypto and that the art world is notorious for its corruption and money laundering potential: https://t.co/83vlBonyHK https://t.co/BBUfOUMfnU
28,money,1/ Our idea to make this space more ethical is by making morality more valuable than money in the future. It will pay off to behave ethically and it will cost you if you behave immorally. We provide a decentralized self-regulatory blueprint as a starting point for discussion.
28,money,"9/ When looking at Zagabond’s digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ"
28,money,"4/ This example highlights the issue of “perverse incentives”. Founders get most of the money during the minting process when the project is only based on “hype”. This continue during the “honeymoon period”, when still a lot of things are promised and OS royalties are flowing in."
28,money,"23/ We do think that it is problematic when we don’t know the ulterior ideology/intentions of the founders, certainly when so much money is involved and all these opportunistic VCs and celebrities are blindly aping into this project. More clarity should be provided."
28,know,"3/ This is not the best way of using our time. Many scammers, fraudsters, thieves and criminals IRL are behaving in the same in the digital world, so it only confirms what most will already know. There are also too many to report about."
28,know,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.

https://t.co/HjnfLA5kY0 https://t.co/4dPqEIIWop"
28,know,"15/ Just so that people know, @NFT asked $20000-$25000 per IG post and the minimum amount was 5 posts, to they would rake in anyway $100k- $125k per project! They also suggested that more posts is relatively cheaper, so ideal for scammers with multiple projects. https://t.co/pe18LOJWDy"
28,know,@RijksdaalderNFT Because there is no centralized entity that keeps track of each project either in advance of minting or afterwards. Also no one knows the connections IRL between the founders and funders of all these projects. They are all in some way (inter)connected.
28,know,"3/ One profile clearly shows involvement in this project and his real Twitter account is screenshotted below. The reason we know this is that when he handed over the project to the community, people discovered this. https://t.co/JvDzlrchti"
28,people,"History will judge very hard on big social media influencers on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc., pretending to be reputable and reliable, for selling a young generation of naive and easily influenced people worthless NFTs for tens of millions of dollars."
28,people,"When you spend too much time solely on CT it's easy to forget how correlated crypto is to equities, other risk assets and sentiment. Just never see many people talking about it on my feed."

28,trust,You can always trust @beaniemaxi to not miss out on a good trade 🧠
28,trust,6/ Let’s start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how “trustworthy” each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
28,trust,"We were contacted by a member of the community who said they claimed the original account for us, and has since handed over the handle. 
We didn’t trust this right away due to the murkiness of the entire situation."
28,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."

29,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good

29,great,"Imagine you are IRL a criminal, crook or conman. And 99% of people know that, so that you can only scam 1%.

And suddenly you hide behind a JPEG, and 99% of people think that you are great, and only 1% knows your shady past.

Some people are laughing all the way to the bank."

29,community,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
29,community,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
29,community,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions “community first”, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all."

29,transparency,Full transparency: we had full belief and intention the reveal would happen when we said - the massive amount of variance proved to be a way larger job to sign off than anticipated. The collection is amazing. It will reveal within the next day when the team has slept.
29,transparency,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
29,transparency,"Many VCs/investors claim to love everything Web3: the transparency, the fact that everyone can participate and no one can be censored/blocked and that transactions on the blockchain are immutable. But they often behave the complete opposite way and they determine Web3's future. https://t.co/I8CiA1WOsY"

29,team,1/ We are going to drop a nuclear bomb on @MetaMansionsNFT and this one is pretty wild. We have heard via a reliable source that the entire team went to Dubai to get UAE citizenship and avoid Canadian income tax. We believe this allegation to be credible. Why?
29,team,"15/ Another Yuga Labs investor is Diplo (DJ Thomas Wesley Pentz), who recently teamed up with Royal, a venture by Justin Blau (also an investor in Yuga Labs), which recently raised $55 million by a16z. https://t.co/lgq4doqoLb"
29,team,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.

https://t.co/22ZIUxgO4H https://t.co/BFMwANNzx7"
29,team,"5/ It would explain why they spent so much money on traveling and also why the whole team had to go there. It also shows bad intent, because if the funds were going to be re-invested, it wouldn't be taxable income. https://t.co/vbGfHbgLUr"
29,team,@beaniemaxi @mando_great @BoredApeYC @coolcatsnft @MetaHero_ @pixelvault_ @punkscomic @Matt_Furie @AvidLines @CryptoKitties @XCOPYART @fewocious @videodrome @Gfunkera86 We love the @pixelvault_! We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
29,project,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

29,project,"This is a must read for anyone, but especially for those that are new(ish) to the NFT space and are planning to mint any project today, tomorrow, or in the coming week(s). Be able to spot the red flags!

https://t.co/J0ggOh6FUW"
29,project,"2/ The last weeks we have been mainly warning for scammers/scams (more than 80% of all newly created projects) in order to protect new, young, naive and easily influenced individuals and educate them to spot the red flags themselves."
29,project,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk
29,project,Of course @hypebearsclub never responded. They count on people that are only active on Instagram and ban anyone who calls them out. Minting day is the finish line for these projects and it's sad that naive people will pay a big price entering the NFT space https://t.co/JvhxUb7JsR https://t.co/Hmzqg7BrnZ
