0,9,transparent,"It takes a lot to build an #NFTproject. Most of it happens behind the scenes.

When TUS was born 4 weeks ago, we made a conscious decision to build in public and be transparent.

Introducing our🤠WEEKLY ROUND-UP🤠👇🏻🧵

#communitybuilding #queerlednft #womenincrypto #nfts"
1,9,transparent,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
2,9,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
3,9,transparent,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
4,9,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
0,9,platform,"For those interested in LooksRare - the investors were already well-known (we were about to do a thread about it). It was telling to see that one of the largest investors was defending all the wash trading on the platform - even saying that ""it's genius"".

3,9,platform,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
4,9,platform,"GM Changemakers! ✨

1,10,new,"2/ The last weeks we have been mainly warning for scammers/scams (more than 80% of all newly created projects) in order to protect new, young, naive and easily influenced individuals and educate them to spot the red flags themselves."
2,10,new,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, “ambassadors”, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot.

0,10,price,Dear @Obluda777 - we just noticed that @SadBotsNFT is minting today. On the website you are listed as the co-founder. Who is the other one and why is (s)he not listed? What justifies a mint price of 0.5 (via a DA) for a vague roadmap? Why are there so many 6388 (&gt;70%) WL spots? https://t.co/3UVYJvUEIJ
1,10,price,"We received DMs from more than 10 people that @crocodood minting later today is a complete scam. We generally call out projects with high mint prices, but the DMs were so extensive (OGs &amp; mod team were banned for asking questions), that we have to share it
https://t.co/ZUFHNHpBlc https://t.co/r4PZKj5ePK"
2,10,price,"6/ The analysis shared by @topshotfund was not completely accurate, as the mint price of many projects was far higher than mentioned in the overview (see the below 4 projects) and also other obvious scams/rugs were not mentioned. https://t.co/SrGMuwZWtG"

4,10,price,"You can’t escape the thought that Yuga Labs changed the Dutch Auction to a flat price of 305 ApeCoin, because they were afraid that the DA would go down to a level that wouldn’t allow Marc Andreessen to purchase yet another house. He already bought 3 houses, so 5 more to go: 305. https://t.co/EKk6UuwwoW"
0,10,believe,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don’t believe in gatekeeping. 

Here’s a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] 🧵👇🏽"
1,10,believe,"12/ For those that only believe things when they hear it (most won't have ever seen him, but will recognize his voice), we provide hereby a short part of a video in which you can hear his voice. He is not visible, because we cut it in such a way that no one is recognizable. https://t.co/bLZNVrYTre"
2,10,believe,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
3,10,believe,9/ Indicating possible criminal acts and/or fraud prevention constitute a legitimate interest or should be regarded as a legitimate interest to dox someone and we believe that is the case for this particular individual as this thread will show.
4,10,believe,"2/ The person in question is MontanaBlack with 1.1M Twitter followers. He basically says he didn't know it was a scam, and couldn't believe it was because it was so ""hyped"". He was happy that others pointed out it was a scam before everything sold out. And DYOR of course!"

1,10,trust,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.

We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
3,10,trust,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
4,10,trust,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
0,10,project,"8/ He also claims that they are using a lot of the funds for traveling. They always travel with the whole team (20+ people) together each week, which is a bit ironic for a project that claims to conquer the metaverse. Maybe first invent a metamansion to reduce your expenses."
1,10,project,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."
2,10,project,"Normally scam projects gain in 2 major ways. First via all the mint money (and royalties), but secondly because the scammers sell off all their free/cheap NFTs they got from the WL sale off on OS during the initial hype for a lot of money. We are breaking that business model."
3,10,project,"7/ We are aware of the sensitivity of doxing someone in the Web3 space, and we recently gave someone a subtle warning. It avoids that you potentially harm someone’s career and project (including their holders), and it serves as an incentive for the person to behave ethically."
4,10,project,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"

1,11,active,2/ Most people active in the NFT space have now (finally) seen the amount of bad actors that are very active/productive and they manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways. The most problematic is when they continue to remain or become more influential in this space.

1,21,blockchain,"5/ We call it TRUSTH and it stands for Transparency, Trust and Truth. Trust refers to your digital actions on the blockchain, Truth refers to your digital words on social media, and Transparency pervades both. They are all (inter)connected."
2,21,blockchain,"What happens to BAYC if all 10k Bored Apes have been bought by (bored) celebrities? They all try to become part of an exciting new community, but will gradually realize that it’s the same community that they are already part of. Good thing you can't photoshop the blockchain."
3,21,blockchain,"19/ Next on the list is a profile named “ZLOVE11”. Via some blockchain transactions, an IG profile and a website, we were able to find this person’s identity, which could be a friend of one of the BAYC founders as he resides in Miami. https://t.co/pu20h0ZPCo"
4,21,blockchain,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."

3,21,crypto,"@NFTethics I think I learnt about the value of decentralisation AFTER being in crypto. It opened my eyes to things that I though were just normal or okay, narratives that have been set by those that want power."
4,21,crypto,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We are not saying that, but we do hope that more experts like you do a deep dive into all those similarly looking and advertised projects that minted in the past week and are about to mint that are all connected. Could potentially be the biggest ""heist"" in NFT history."
0,21,investment,"@NFTherder @gmcapital_ One of the many reasons why we decided to release the information is that we had serious doubts about the existence of the investment fund. Apart from Beanie's background, the ISIN number did not match any database records and also consisted of 3 country code letters instead of 2 https://t.co/zmwVjhWWGf"
1,21,investment,"2/ Via the OpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received “NFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investments”. We confirmed that these are genuine (seed) investors. https://t.co/phDWGuGilG"
2,21,investment,"@arvinlolme @NFTherder Yes, in the thread he mentions that 3 months ago he made you aware of this and that nothing has been done yet. A bit more pro-activity wouldn't hurt don't you think? Certainly given the small investment it requires and the huge amount of primary/secondary sales in comparison."
3,21,investment,The business model of VCs is that the best investment in a successful fund/venture equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund/ventures combined. It’s the same with NFTs and this Web3 model is now brought into the lives of ordinary people. The implications are far-reaching.
4,21,investment,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
0,21,market,"2/ He bought a lot of NFTs at the top and when the market went down, he was allegedly $10 million under water. He manufactured a fake argument with Nifty Gateway (see article) and he then got into DMs with all artists he bought from https://t.co/WH48ZmfIBN"
1,21,market,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately “survive”, so the current state of the market is that “bad news” for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
2,21,market,"Welp, trust me to have the ""rekt city"" auction end on terrible day for the market.

Current bid is 16.5ETH, ends at 5PM EST today!"
3,21,market,"5/ And then there is a Twitter Spaces with Nima Ghassemi, the main co-founder, who claims that he will use 50% of the budget for marketing. But at the same time he also claims he has a very successful marketing company generating $3 million a year. 🤡https://t.co/Cw3lzW26cQ https://t.co/Bn70BZ5zSn"
4,21,market,Gendered marketing sucks in general. It also totally disregards gender diversity and those that are gender fluid. Let’s just like what we like and fight against toxic gender roles 💪
0,21,asset,"2/ And thread 2 (which mentions that their ""biggest client is @reshadeth a 15 year old""). It involves (in)direct proof of identity fraud, getting around KYC/AML laws, wire fraud, giving and/or receiving capital assets to a minor which legally cannot invest

1,22,yesterday,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

2,22,yesterday,"1/ Another day, another rug pull. This time Lazy Lion Ape Club - 626 were minted for 0.08 ETH each yesterday, so that is 50 ETH profit.

1,22,wallet,"4/ Justin Rose is part of the VC True Ventures, and together with GaryVee invested in Justin Aversano's Quantum Art. Also the FlamingoDAO of which both Justin and Gary are part invested in Quantum Art. So that explains why Aversano via his TwinFlames wallet paid 0.001 ETH (=$3) https://t.co/W59QJhgjt5"

3,22,wallet,"12/ They use a lot of different wallets to obfuscate all the transactions, but this transaction of 449 ETH was from one project alone. So how much did they rake in from all the other projects? https://t.co/mKc7DnWN9u"
4,22,wallet,"What is impossible IRL is possible in the NFT world. Two @CowgirlsNFT are dating 2 @pudgy_penguins (all founders) and they took advice from @ColeThereum how to drain wallets. No joke and we hope they fix this for the community. Full story from the head mod

1,22,transparency,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."
2,22,transparency,"@Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts It's just an innocent question. Web3 is all about transparency, so we are curious why the tweets are protected. Nothing more."
3,22,transparency,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
4,22,transparency,Ok so transparency is good. Providing platform to someone to use sexist and ableist slurs ain’t it. Tuning out.

0,25,member,23/ One potentially other interesting aspect is that many of the Yuga Labs execs originate from a company called “Something New”. We identified at least 5 members and it could well be that this company has a financial stake in the success of Yuga. https://t.co/nxUrxkTAyt

4,26,story,"1/ A quick update on MontanaBlack who in actual fact seems to have &gt;20 million followers on all kinds of platforms. The story shows how many of these scam rings operate. There is always someone in the background doing the ""dirty"" work functioning as the intermediary and fall guy. https://t.co/SVtpeby664"
0,26,project,"9/ We have received confirmation from multiple independent sources that Marc Cuban's @NFT venture offered equity to projects that had the potential to sell out. That would also explain why they received so much money from certain projects and why they did so much ""due diligence"". https://t.co/zlFX9mwfXM"
1,26,project,"We wrote about these projects a while back and @zachxbt has now provided much more detail. With what we know, this is not in any way an exception, and there are so many hypocritical and corrupt(ed) influencers who all pretend to be reputable. They are not.
https://t.co/kYJKOg0Jwo"
2,26,project,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
3,26,project,1/2 What are the reasons that founders don’t want to dox themselves? It allows them to walk away from the project without any reputational damage and do it again. Or it allows others to dig into their past (IRL or in the NFT space) and find some of their skeletons in the closet.
4,26,project,"Almost every day for two weeks, a new project founder has dm’d me looking for moral support after dealing with intense harassment. We need to cultivate a culture that maintains a certain level of respect for each other as humans - mental health isn’t something you can buy. 1/"
0,27,good,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility 🤝💖"
1,27,good,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.

3,27,good,"4/ A project that started off as a scam, can still become successful (for unexpected reasons) to a degree that the founders (or persons in charge) think it’s worthwhile to continue it. In the same way projects that started with only good intentions can still fail dramatically."

1,27,really,14/ Many people now start to notice that our statement below was not an exaggeration. It served as a real warning to really do your research and see the characteristics that all these scam projects have in common (in the same way you distinguish spam emails from legit ones). https://t.co/gyYHnKYMEH

4,27,really,"@NFTethics @moonbirds_xyz I’m gutted because when you first came into the scene you wrote good shit and it was a real prevention mechanism for future scammers. 

Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It’s a shame really."
0,27,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
1,27,transparent,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
2,27,transparent,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
3,27,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
4,27,transparent,"We need a non-profit advertising service that applies some level of due-diligence on the projects it promotes with standardised and transparent fees. 

All profits go to charity. 

I'd work on this for free if people are interested hmu."

3,27,blue,1/ Our idea to make this space more ethical is by making morality more valuable than money in the future. It will pay off to behave ethically and it will cost you if you behave immorally. We provide a decentralized self-regulatory blueprint as a starting point for discussion.
4,27,blue,"It looks like the SEC's experience with @ElonMusk, the owner of the first NFT Company or Company NFT that was shilled on Twitter, will likely serve as a blueprint for the future regulation of NFTs. More background here: https://t.co/KU17A6PENE"

3,27,make,"@LupianoTrip Yes, we receive around 200 DMs per day. We read them all, but have to make priorities in terms of what we think is most worthwhile researching into. But all the information has allowed us to get a good understanding of the space. And Twitter's recent DM search feature has helped."

Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
3,27,trust,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
4,27,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."

0,28,ago,"18/ This whole story is made even worse when you see an interview that Jason Falovitch did a couple of months ago. Not sure why he is filmed in something that looks like a prison cell, but maybe he is preparing for what is coming. https://t.co/XoPfu2lzG8"
1,28,ago,"63/ He also revealed to have run the largest hacker IRC, that he moved out of Canada more than 22 years ago for tax reasons, and that he has 30 years of professional trolling. https://t.co/xARwEx00Js"
2,28,ago,"17/ But it gets worse: The Block posted an article a couple of years ago about the connection between Coinbase, 0x Labs and Scalar Capital. They have removed that article, maybe because Mike Dudas now has his own fund backed by a16z. https://t.co/y3mXpKseMJ"
3,28,ago,"More than 3 months ago, the ratio of well intentioned projects and bad intentioned ones was probably around 80%-20%. 

That ratio has in our view shifted: 80% are now likely scams and 20% are projects that really want to build something.

1,28,money,2. Equities = you own a share of the company and may get paid dividends/benefit in capital appreciation from growth. Bonds/loans = you lend money to a company and get paid interest. Obviously there are various financial ratios we use to help us get to a concept of valuation.
2,28,money,11/ Zagabond was asked about all the ICO scams and said: “you should at least have done as much work as you could have done on the project before trying to raise money”. Maybe he also forgot about that when raising money with his NFT projects and abandoning them. https://t.co/LfuM2qverZ

2,28,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
3,28,trust,"Btw, I'd strongly recommend learning to use @flipsfinance. We're gonna put out some tutorials on it soon but I would really really recommend getting proficient at it; trust me you'll want to!"
4,28,trust,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
0,29,roadmap,"@OttoSuwenNFT It was indeed a conservative estimation. It could well be even above 95%. These scammers are basically factories that churn out project after project - just mindless JPEGs, without any vision/roadmap.

2,29,term,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don’t mint. It’s quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."

0,29,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
1,29,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
2,29,transparent,"❓❓❓ What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
✔ NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
3,29,transparent,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
4,29,transparent,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.

2,29,transparency,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
3,29,transparency,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people.

1,29,team,"If you are new to the NFT space, our advice would be not to mint ANY project for the coming 2 weeks. We have indications that the same scam team created many projects each day, and they only have a limited time window before they are found out. That's why they delay the ""reveal""."
2,29,team,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.

0,29,project,"It's a well-known trick if you have been long enough in this space. It's possible that for certain projects (certainly those with unethical people) the ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up all the rare items for cheap
https://t.co/8TMBhQn0Ro"
1,29,project,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F
2,29,project,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico’s Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"
3,29,project,"2/ People feel especially betrayed by the fact that only 30 ETH was left in the community fund for further development, while 90 ETH in total seemed to have been paid to some of the moderators. The founders seem to have left the project with more than 1700 ETH."
4,29,project,"In some way it's unnecessary to also mention the project FashionApe, but because it's minting this week and just for the avoidance of doubt - it's all the same scam over and over again (just like MetaTribes) https://t.co/EK5eFypES5 https://t.co/ksZ1fYcH1m"
