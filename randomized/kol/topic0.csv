0,collection,"With @MuriNFT being a legitimate collection by @haustwts, it shows that once a project does well and reputable, it immediately creates many copycats that try to benefit from a particular brand or its success. We have seen this with (Bored) Apes, Wolf Game, etc, etc."

0,happy,19/ Counties such as Canada are happy to welcome rich people from Iran using the “no questions asked” policy. This is just one example – we could have equally mentioned many other countries but it’s just to make the point that many countries have similar policies. https://t.co/32G89Oljjw

2,happy,"20/ Many influencers &amp; artists don’t care about where the money is coming from or is going (hint: LooksRare). As long as they make money and people buy their art for enormous amounts, they are happy to say how great and beneficial NFTs are. Changing the narrative sometimes helps. https://t.co/GaDdk4UlFs"
3,happy,Dear Amir (@mondoir) - a quick reminder to let you know that your company accounts are overdue. Just letting you know in case you don't have an accountant or they were not able to contact you. Always happy to help. https://t.co/g5lCAxKnNi
4,happy,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.

1,friend,"14/ If you are part of the inner circle (as a project or as an individual) - it literally even says ""best friends"", then you will certainly be able to benefit from the generosity, altruism and inclusivity of this project.

0,love,@phuktep @JaymesWestfall @DeezeFi @dsphoto1985 This is bullshit. Deeze is one of the good guys and genuinely just loves the banter of collecting NFTs. I'd trust him with my unborn children.
1,love,"9/ We also see a lot of messages about generosity, altruism and friendship, but that applies especially to the true friends of friendsies who received free mints and have to shill this ecosystem ""powered by love, good vibes, and friendship"". https://t.co/2t0vkIJ0Xc"
2,love,"When people say they love decentralization, it's often because they are part of a centralized narrative from a centralized network that requires you to exchange your currently ""centralized"" FIAT money to crypto, so that they can (ab)use that in a ""centralized"" way. The irony."
3,love,"Many VCs/investors claim to love everything Web3: the transparency, the fact that everyone can participate and no one can be censored/blocked and that transactions on the blockchain are immutable. But they often behave the complete opposite way and they determine Web3's future. https://t.co/I8CiA1WOsY"
