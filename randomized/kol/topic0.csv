The project has so many red flags, and we didn't even mention all the fake Twitter profiles (see screenshots) https://t.co/bykBDYLrmy"

Already 2 months ago, someone created the below chart and dropped it in the Ancient Cats Club Discord after it was rugged. https://t.co/jU3Xmgafxa"

0,0,algorithm,"23/ If you don’t disclose this information, but it is found out by others/algorithms, it can have an impact on your TRUSTH scores. It’s unfortunate that mechanisms and measures like this are necessary, but as we said earlier: https://t.co/SfSzt0fesq"
1,0,algorithm,"14/ Once the algorithm is defined and tested, the idea is that everyone will receive their score which remains invisible for a few weeks. If you have a low score you can do nothing, but you risk the value of your NFT assets will go to 0 and not being part of the community anymore"
2,0,algorithm,"There are 2 nightmare scenarios:

1. The foundations of the Metaverse are built by and for charlatans (possibly the current scenario)

2. The Metaverse is completely regulated by AI algorithms in an Orwellian way (possibly a future scenario)

Finding a middle way will be the key."
3,0,algorithm,"16/ After that moment, the TRUSTH scores will start to become dependent on your trading behavior, and how much it can go up/down will depend on a smart algorithm that takes into account your buying/selling pattern and volume."
4,0,algorithm,6/ Let’s start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how “trustworthy” each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
0,0,apart,"8/ The two devs of BAYC, Kerem Atalay and Zeshan Ali, both graduated from the University of Maryland (Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences), but apart from that, we have not been able to find much more about them. https://t.co/3UxSyU0Frn"
1,0,apart,"10/ We did indeed find that also Gregory Solano also graduated from the University of Maryland, and didn’t find anything about Wylie Aranow, apart from the fact that his father was very (in)famous and some of the info he revealed in interviews (""his gambling-problem days""). https://t.co/LyF9VFtQCQ"
0,0,block,"2/ The CEO of MoonPay, @isotowright, gave an interview with @theblock__, but some of the questions were not (properly) answered, so we would like to ask these questions again. The article can be found here (and we will refer to it in the tweets below): https://t.co/NIsofaeOtN"
1,0,block,"Many VCs/investors claim to love everything Web3: the transparency, the fact that everyone can participate and no one can be censored/blocked and that transactions on the blockchain are immutable. But they often behave the complete opposite way and they determine Web3's future. https://t.co/I8CiA1WOsY"
2,0,block,@Defacedstudio @BilndArt Just tell everyone it was organic and block NFT ethics so they don’t tweet about us. 🤝
3,0,block,"If you or anyone else gets banned/blocked from Discord/Twitter by an NFT project for asking legitimate questions or voicing legitimate concerns, it's immediately a very red flag. It stands for everything that Web3 doesn't stand for https://t.co/hCSuLnzJOf"
4,0,block,"18/ This can be based on different metrics: the repetitiveness/originality of messages, the amount of deleted messages, the number of times people are blocked by this account, the number of times the handle has changed, ratio of followers to friends, interaction, etc."
