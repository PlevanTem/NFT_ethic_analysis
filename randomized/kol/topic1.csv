0,1,moral,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"
1,1,moral,"3/ Decentralization has various advantages, but also specific disadvantages for which the NFT space currently does not have a solution. Anonymous people have less of an incentive (or even no incentive at all) to act morally/ethically and to take accountability for their actions."
2,1,moral,"3/ Money has the capacity to turn morality into a matter of impersonal arithmetic and by doing so, can justify things that would otherwise seem outrageous or obscene (David Graeber). Use the power (and money) that you have been given responsibly/ethically. https://t.co/0ldO7QK0SS"
3,1,moral,"Remembering not to shame others when their idea of integrity is different to yours. As long as nobody is being harmed, let’s respect each other’s moral code."
4,1,moral,2/ Of course Mark Cuban said that he didn’t know about it (many billionaires are immoral hypocrites that pretend to be blissfully “ignorant” about unethical aspects of their own companies). See @coffeezilla’s short video for more background: https://t.co/klVDF5XWUz https://t.co/H6BCpyVISM

2,1,space,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"
3,1,space,17/ In some podcasts you can’t escape the thought that they have used their young audience in the esports space to attract their parents to become part of this particular NFT project. The influence of esports/Fortnite streamers in the NFT space cannot be underestimated.
