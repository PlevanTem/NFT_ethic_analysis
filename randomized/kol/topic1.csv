1,1,project,"2/ Some mentioned that we should check the purchases of proof collective, as many wallets only contains the proof collection and the floor is now 88 ETH. Wash trading is so common in so many projects these days that it's not even noteworthy anymore. https://t.co/zgVpXsxzNC"
2,1,project,"12/ To be fair to Beanie, he actually contributed in many ways to the NFT space. His tweets were intelligent and engaging about interesting projects, and nothing compared to what we currently see with scam rings using the “Follow, Retweet &amp; WL/Giveaway”, incentivized by greed."
3,1,project,"3/ They are not interested in the content on the NFT project (as exemplified yesterday where MontanaBlack promoted a project that included a Swastika), but only by money/whitelist spots. If they don't get what they want, they start to publicly call legitimate projects a ""scam"". https://t.co/oFDHpM16gv"
4,1,project,"Of course @DoodlesCatsNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community, no website, nothing. When you have (serious) doubts about a project, avoid. https://t.co/ffwvprkZ9u"

To onboard more underrepresented groups into #web3, we need transparency and free flow of knowledge &amp; insights, especially with the beast that is launching an #NFTProject!

4,1,new,"The behavior of @elonmusk is similar to many Web3 influencers. First FUDing Twitter by suggesting things are wrong and he might create a new social media platform. He creates leverage &amp; buys the dip. Stock price goes up &amp; he can use the platform to shill.

1,1,work,"1/ If you are not aware of any crypto history and didn't follow the current Ripple lawsuit and the dubious role that Bill Hinman played as the director of the SEC's division of corporate finance, you won't understand the full picture. He now works for Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). https://t.co/ZbYKx51JZg"
2,1,work,"24/ Also remember that if you ever see a tweet from @jf_nft in which he asks which NFT to buy, he is likely buying it with your money that he gained via all kinds of dodgy scams. This whole space is filled with charlatans, and many are high profile names that operate in networks."
3,1,work,"Was just informed I was added to this list. Blocked, not expending energy on it. Striving for equality and inclusivity isn’t ‘wokeism’.

0,1,moral,"Remembering not to shame others when their idea of integrity is different to yours. As long as nobody is being harmed, let’s respect each other’s moral code."
1,1,moral,"15/ Also with his current company he has shown that his moral compass is not pointing in the right direction, but if you have a net worth of over $13 billion, not many people are able to stand up against someone with so much money and influence.

2,1,moral,2/ Of course Mark Cuban said that he didn’t know about it (many billionaires are immoral hypocrites that pretend to be blissfully “ignorant” about unethical aspects of their own companies). See @coffeezilla’s short video for more background: https://t.co/klVDF5XWUz https://t.co/H6BCpyVISM
3,1,moral,"24/ Are there no good people? Of course, there are. The majority is good, but as we already mentioned before this space favors the least ethical and most immoral persons, and they are productive and dominant in this space. And it influences others to behave unethically as well."
