0,1,accomplish,@Ape7068 @psych_nft You would prefer me to ask women not to reduce men to their marital status to be fair despite it not being a thing? Assuming equality doesn’t make it so. Men’s accomplishments are never eclipsed by their marital status.
0,1,believe,"17/ The so called “big lie” is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6"
1,1,believe,9/ Indicating possible criminal acts and/or fraud prevention constitute a legitimate interest or should be regarded as a legitimate interest to dox someone and we believe that is the case for this particular individual as this thread will show.
2,1,believe,4/ We have heard various people say that this is simply the “dark side of decentralization” and it’s just “part of the game”. But we believe that might well be a logical fallacy. Let’s give some examples.
3,1,believe,"2/ The person in question is MontanaBlack with 1.1M Twitter followers. He basically says he didn't know it was a scam, and couldn't believe it was because it was so ""hyped"". He was happy that others pointed out it was a scam before everything sold out. And DYOR of course!"
4,1,believe,@0xAllen_ @AhmedPartey With our statement we meant that we believe over 80% of all projects that are coming out have no interest in developing the project after mint date (other than some quick OS royalties that they can gain by delaying the reveal). The businesses that fail are in the other 20%.
0,1,character,"2/ After we posted that we would expose some scam rings in Dubai (where you live), you decided to close the Discord for any new members. Did you know that one of the characteristics of Web3 is that everyone should be able to participate and there should be no “gatekeepers”? https://t.co/yIcBVUJt2O"
1,1,character,14/ Many people now start to notice that our statement below was not an exaggeration. It served as a real warning to really do your research and see the characteristics that all these scam projects have in common (in the same way you distinguish spam emails from legit ones). https://t.co/gyYHnKYMEH
2,1,character,"Just a quick reminder that we have never blocked/muted anyone on Twitter and never will. It's one of the fundamental characteristics of Web3. Many other big influencers have blocked us, all pretending to be Web3 evangelists, but they don't practice what they preach (as so often). https://t.co/eHdA5bMe3n"
3,1,character,"2/ With increasing consolidation (read: centralization), larger NFT projects will start to have more responsibility for the NFT space as a whole and need to align their decisions accordingly to capture the true Web3 characteristics and spirit. https://t.co/LKaxFe8ZUU"
4,1,character,"6/ Or are there certain characteristics that should serve as a red flags, in the same way that spam filters detect spam. There are so many projects coming out each day and alerting people is time-sensitive. After mint, it is not relevant anymore. That always is a trade-off."

🔥Sign up has been removed and @WalletConnect has been introduced to provide full #decentralization.
🔥@Metamask, @TrustWallet and other @WalletConnect apps have been integrated.

1,1,apps,"51/ Beanie was already known to be using many different aliases in order to influence, deceive and manipulate people during his TV piracy business, and that pattern seems to have continued during his time with TokenPay. But certain apps show the name based on your phone number... https://t.co/aWtEDRq5A4"
0,1,argue,"61/ In general it is ironic that many of these big influencers argue against those malicious big centralized corporations, but they have become themselves the centralized entities (VCs, Big Tech) that they purport to replace."
0,1,community,"@punk6529 Yes, based on the below observation, we had truly hoped that the NFT community would be more creative and innovative. https://t.co/G3IySapILy"
1,1,community,"We could tell you about our #NFTProject &amp; Mentorship Program… but we’ll let our community of Changemakers do the talking❤️

2,1,community,There’s a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don’t know how I would do this without those people. 💖
