1,pic,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.

3,pic,I don’t have any spicy takes on today’s news but I will defend the notion of anonymity in Web3. There are so many working anon here for many reasons including personal safety &amp; the ability to navigate the space without the bias that may follow their intersecting identities.
4,pic,"20/ The 2 Scalar Capital founders were heavily involved in developing Coinbase’s listing procedures along with an engineer (Maksim Stepanenko), who was an advisor to Scalar. The sudden manner in which Coinbase listed 0x (price climbed up 17% within an hour) attracted suspicions. https://t.co/eaposggJkZ"

0,price,"The behavior of @elonmusk is similar to many Web3 influencers. First FUDing Twitter by suggesting things are wrong and he might create a new social media platform. He creates leverage &amp; buys the dip. Stock price goes up &amp; he can use the platform to shill.

0,project,"4/ A project that started off as a scam, can still become successful (for unexpected reasons) to a degree that the founders (or persons in charge) think it’s worthwhile to continue it. In the same way projects that started with only good intentions can still fail dramatically."
1,project,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
2,project,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don’t mint. It’s quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."
3,project,"6/ It shows that new incentive-based contracts are required. An example could be that 10% of all the mint money goes to the project founders, and 90% to a community wallet. Only after a milestone on the roadmap is met, a percentage of the money will be paid out to the founders."
4,project,"Even when you think everything with a project is going well - it's still possible that things are wrong with the underlying smart contract and that the art/metadata is actually centralized on a website that is about to expire. A technical rug?

https://t.co/3yi82PAf5L"
0,profile,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"
1,profile,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F
2,profile,"2/ Less people seem however be aware of the history of one of the co-founders of https://t.co/VWfnZRszxI (""his"" company), even though this is fully disclosed on both Ohhshiny's profile and Digital's IG page. The person is Steven Cohen and the below book was written about him. https://t.co/ViJC5QUJKn"
3,profile,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico’s Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"
4,profile,"3/ One of the co-founders, who they claim is a blockchain expert, does have a gap on his LinkedIn profile of about 5 years. We found how he was able to increase his knowledge about Web3 (screenshots attached). https://t.co/sACZIi7BJa"
0,transparency,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are “dedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication”. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2"

2,transparency,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
3,transparency,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2"
4,transparency,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
