2,10,new,"For those who don't know about the dubious history of the account NFTmachine. He blocked us immediately for a reason, even though we never reported about him. He probably knew we would however at some point do that.

All credits to @0xShual.

0,10,price,"For those that are new. The floor price normally goes up after minting, and continues to remain above minting price until the reveal. After that it can quickly go down below mint price. That's why many ""scam projects"" delay the reveal. HypeBears was able to get &gt;$1M today via OS."
1,10,price,"PixelSaurus is an #NFT collection for the whole family to collect. Our fun, non-generative designs are diverse and inclusive and our 2 collections are priced from just 0.02 &amp; 0.03 ETH, to make them accessible. We’re also verified on @opensea! #NFTs

2,10,price,"We said it before, but for people new(ish) to the space, there is simply no justification to ask millions upfront by undoxxed, unproven teams with nothing than some fancy JPEGs and fake influencers promoting it.

Mint price for many past projects was &lt;0.1

https://t.co/qVE9dmGOSk"
3,10,price,"1/ We received quite a lot of requests to look at @metamansionsnft, which is minting later this week. The mint price alone (0.88 ETH) is already a red flag, but there are many more. They are doing a “giveaway” of 888 ETH (10% of the mint profit) but only when it sells out AND…"
4,10,price,"The behavior of @elonmusk is similar to many Web3 influencers. First FUDing Twitter by suggesting things are wrong and he might create a new social media platform. He creates leverage &amp; buys the dip. Stock price goes up &amp; he can use the platform to shill.
https://t.co/S480vCYNk8"
0,10,believe,4/ We have heard various people say that this is simply the “dark side of decentralization” and it’s just “part of the game”. But we believe that might well be a logical fallacy. Let’s give some examples.
1,10,believe,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
2,10,believe,"17/ The so called “big lie” is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6"
3,10,believe,1/ We are going to drop a nuclear bomb on @MetaMansionsNFT and this one is pretty wild. We have heard via a reliable source that the entire team went to Dubai to get UAE citizenship and avoid Canadian income tax. We believe this allegation to be credible. Why?
4,10,believe,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
0,10,mint,"2/ Via the OpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received “NFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investments”. We confirmed that these are genuine (seed) investors. https://t.co/phDWGuGilG"

2,10,mint,"2/ When will the risks be shifted from the holders/minters to the founders? When will ""free mints"" become the norm, and the founders will have to work in order to get the sales royalties coming in? This is a constant liquidity drain and not sustainable for the NFT ecosystem."
3,10,mint,"We simply have to all agree that we don’t mint any project with mint prices &gt;0.1 (ideally lower). It will disincentive scammers to go for cash grabs, will keep more liquidity in the NFT/ETH ecosystem and will create more innovation in this space (e.g. performance-based contracts)"
4,10,mint,"The project @DeluxeGoat is 99.9% a scam (also minting today). Founders have 0 and 1 post on IG. They paid for Google ads, and one of the founders could well be the same one as the one from ""Immortal Apes"" as he writes gas both times in an unusual (and incorrect) way. Gass what? https://t.co/RamDHzBDxe"
0,10,invest,"We wonder if the two @LooksRareNFT founders, Guts and @ZoddLooksRare, would be willing to give some clarification on why they seem to use a Chinese proxy for their company filings in the UK and Canada. And whether all the influencer investors in LooksRare know their identities. https://t.co/IxUePOH66f"
1,10,invest,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr
2,10,invest,2/ In MontanaBlack's case that is the below person with &gt;150k followers on Twitter. This whole thread is courtesy to @shinraton who reported this in German. He also shared the DM's of this person who is looking for projects that he and MontanaBlack can invest in (see screenshots) https://t.co/0VRoUUAJlm
3,10,invest,"The NFT space basically consists of two worlds: 

1. Experienced investors that use Twitter/reputable contacts for their info. 
2. Inexperienced naifs that get their info from paid shills at Instagram.

They never talk about or even mention the same projects."
4,10,invest,"18/ On the list is also Jason Galvanis, CEO of CAMEO, a company that a16z seems to have missed out on but did include in their marketplace 100. Snoop Dogg (real name: Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.) backs this venture and he is also an investor in Yuga Labs. https://t.co/josXgmVOiu"

1,10,trust,"Welp, trust me to have the ""rekt city"" auction end on terrible day for the market.

Current bid is 16.5ETH, ends at 5PM EST today!"
2,10,trust,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"

0,10,project,"3/ Doctor Troller (AKA Andrew Brown) was the founder of a project called @CrocsLeague, which was a complete rug pull. The website from Crocs does not show the team anymore, but the Way Back Machine still shows the team. It also shows Asha Serano, his partner (in crime). https://t.co/jxja8Nc0p6"
1,10,project,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.

https://t.co/22ZIUxgO4H https://t.co/BFMwANNzx7"
2,10,project,"2/ It remains strange to us that many that are planning to spend 0.5 ETH on any project, don’t seem to do any research at all. If someone on the street asks you to give him/her $1300 USD as an investment into something, wouldn’t you do any proper due diligence?"
3,10,project,"If you are new to the NFT space, our advice would be not to mint ANY project for the coming 2 weeks. We have indications that the same scam team created many projects each day, and they only have a limited time window before they are found out. That's why they delay the ""reveal""."
4,10,project,There’s a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don’t know how I would do this without those people. 💖
0,10,transparency,"23/ Scalar Capital is also an investor in Dfinity, which is the former employer of Whizwang (Elizabeth Yang), and Twitter shows that the 2 know each other. Whizwang deleted many tweets (for transparency purposes probably) but did mention that she was part of the zunks team. https://t.co/Hre7maeY1f"

2,10,transparency,"@CoachP1421 @MetaKryptVault Just to let you know that we have also been blocked by this person, even though we had never heard of this account before (and never reported about them).
