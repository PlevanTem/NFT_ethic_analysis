0,10,new,"Sad to see that the same group of prolific serial scammers continue with their rugs: Boss Apes (minting now), Pikapunks, LazyLionz (with a Z), Hype Ape Club, Cyber Charizard, Bored CloneX, Dogdles, etc. Each week a new project, facilitated by the same 10-20 large Twitter accounts https://t.co/3GqByCtzdt"
1,10,new,"2/ The last weeks we have been mainly warning for scammers/scams (more than 80% of all newly created projects) in order to protect new, young, naive and easily influenced individuals and educate them to spot the red flags themselves."
2,10,new,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, “ambassadors”, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot. Even though it was marked as “fake news”, a Discord message and recording shows otherwise https://t.co/hztXbSW3kw https://t.co/UBzguUxSMJ"

0,10,price,Dear @Obluda777 - we just noticed that @SadBotsNFT is minting today. On the website you are listed as the co-founder. Who is the other one and why is (s)he not listed? What justifies a mint price of 0.5 (via a DA) for a vague roadmap? Why are there so many 6388 (&gt;70%) WL spots? https://t.co/3UVYJvUEIJ
1,10,price,"We received DMs from more than 10 people that @crocodood minting later today is a complete scam. We generally call out projects with high mint prices, but the DMs were so extensive (OGs &amp; mod team were banned for asking questions), that we have to share it
https://t.co/ZUFHNHpBlc https://t.co/r4PZKj5ePK"
2,10,price,"6/ The analysis shared by @topshotfund was not completely accurate, as the mint price of many projects was far higher than mentioned in the overview (see the below 4 projects) and also other obvious scams/rugs were not mentioned. https://t.co/SrGMuwZWtG"

4,10,price,"You can’t escape the thought that Yuga Labs changed the Dutch Auction to a flat price of 305 ApeCoin, because they were afraid that the DA would go down to a level that wouldn’t allow Marc Andreessen to purchase yet another house. He already bought 3 houses, so 5 more to go: 305. https://t.co/EKk6UuwwoW"
0,10,believe,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don’t believe in gatekeeping. 

Here’s a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] 🧵👇🏽"
1,10,believe,"12/ For those that only believe things when they hear it (most won't have ever seen him, but will recognize his voice), we provide hereby a short part of a video in which you can hear his voice. He is not visible, because we cut it in such a way that no one is recognizable. https://t.co/bLZNVrYTre"
2,10,believe,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
3,10,believe,9/ Indicating possible criminal acts and/or fraud prevention constitute a legitimate interest or should be regarded as a legitimate interest to dox someone and we believe that is the case for this particular individual as this thread will show.
4,10,believe,"2/ The person in question is MontanaBlack with 1.1M Twitter followers. He basically says he didn't know it was a scam, and couldn't believe it was because it was so ""hyped"". He was happy that others pointed out it was a scam before everything sold out. And DYOR of course!"

3,10,invest,"4/ Justin Rose is part of the VC True Ventures, and together with GaryVee invested in Justin Aversano's Quantum Art.

0,10,trust,"Why scammers &amp; fraudsters thrive? Research shows that people tend to default to trusting others over distrusting them, believing them over doubting them and going along with someone’s self-presentation rather than embarrassing them by calling them out. https://t.co/KAu7BQh7JG"
1,10,trust,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
2,10,trust,@beaniemaxi @mando_great @BoredApeYC @coolcatsnft @MetaHero_ @pixelvault_ @punkscomic @Matt_Furie @AvidLines @CryptoKitties @XCOPYART @fewocious @videodrome @Gfunkera86 We love the @pixelvault_! We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
3,10,trust,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
4,10,trust,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
0,10,project,"8/ He also claims that they are using a lot of the funds for traveling. They always travel with the whole team (20+ people) together each week, which is a bit ironic for a project that claims to conquer the metaverse. Maybe first invent a metamansion to reduce your expenses."
1,10,project,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."
2,10,project,"Normally scam projects gain in 2 major ways. First via all the mint money (and royalties), but secondly because the scammers sell off all their free/cheap NFTs they got from the WL sale off on OS during the initial hype for a lot of money. We are breaking that business model."
3,10,project,"7/ We are aware of the sensitivity of doxing someone in the Web3 space, and we recently gave someone a subtle warning. It avoids that you potentially harm someone’s career and project (including their holders), and it serves as an incentive for the person to behave ethically."
4,10,project,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"
0,10,transparency,"We wish we had this a month ago!

To onboard more underrepresented groups into #web3, we need transparency and free flow of knowledge &amp; insights, especially with the beast that is launching an #NFTProject!

Highly recommend all new (or wannabe) NFT Creators check this one out. 🙌🏽"
1,10,transparency,"❓❓❓ What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
✔ NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
2,10,transparency,"@Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts It's just an innocent question. Web3 is all about transparency, so we are curious why the tweets are protected. Nothing more."
3,10,transparency,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are “dedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication”. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2"
