1,transparent,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don’t believe in gatekeeping. 

Here’s a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] 🧵👇🏽"
2,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
3,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
4,transparent,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."
