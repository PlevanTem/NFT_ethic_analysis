1,11,mint,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
2,11,mint,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, “ambassadors”, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot. Even though it was marked as “fake news”, a Discord message and recording shows otherwise https://t.co/hztXbSW3kw https://t.co/UBzguUxSMJ"
3,11,mint,"27/ It is ironic that Beanie often mentions his dislike for low-effort copy pastas, when we have to conclude that Monkey Bet DAO and Baboon Bet (1000 ETH mint in total) was nothing more than just that: a copy pasta of RGT’s earlier products. https://t.co/YHhDc8nukM"
4,11,mint,"@NFTherder We lack the resources/time to check each and every project properly and specifically mentioned NEW people not to mint. Proof is also very hard to find before mint, when it is most urgent to warn people but we see a clear pattern. We hope more people invest time into research."
0,11,dev,"Three months ago @nesotual was a co-founder of @gemxyz (see video at 6:28: https://t.co/UVZ8pu4d4F), but after the sexual misconduct allegations, @LorensHuculak mentioned he was a anon developer &amp; team member. Next time maybe also check out what other ENS profiles he registered. https://t.co/kwS6BwWXSb"
1,11,dev,"RIP Metabots. This isn't the first rug pull and won't be the last. Find a dev team you trust, and make sure the art isn't stolen! We could do with an overall ""background"" check of artwork of all recent collectibles tbh."
2,11,dev,"8/ The two devs of BAYC, Kerem Atalay and Zeshan Ali, both graduated from the University of Maryland (Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences), but apart from that, we have not been able to find much more about them. https://t.co/3UxSyU0Frn"
3,11,dev,"Corporations entering NFTs: 
1. Tweet GM
2. Buy a punk/BAYC
3. Commit to decentralisation &amp; ethical development through restructuring of existing systems.
(That last part is made up but what needs to happen for their Web3 integrations to be meaningful)."
4,11,dev,"@diverse @023 We have asked some legitimate questions and leave it up to others to judge whether they find your answers satisfactory. We have more info about the other founder (who also lost his IG verification) and his GF, and about your dev Praj that was associated with the banned @NFT IG. https://t.co/flasygWtMY"
0,11,active,"41/ He became active on Twitter trying to provide his analysis on mid cap stocks. His Twitter bio had the slogan “Buy Grief, Sell Hype”. What he is doing with NFTs now, he more or less used to do with stocks. Not everyone always agreed with his analyses... https://t.co/oRgsfQo0l2"
1,11,active,2/ Most people active in the NFT space have now (finally) seen the amount of bad actors that are very active/productive and they manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways. The most problematic is when they continue to remain or become more influential in this space.
2,11,active,"17/ The so called “big lie” is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6"
3,11,active,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."
4,11,active,"@artskooltourist @Friendswithyou The tweet served the purpose to show that they were ""reasonably early"" active in the NFT space and connected with many currently quite prominent NFT ""influencers""."
0,11,trust,"2/2 When confronted with that, he said that his account was hacked by someone else and that he didn't have anything to do with it. In December the kind soul @Zeneca_33 already wrote a thread about him. Shame that a small minority makes us all less trustful https://t.co/EYdquGmTg4"

2,11,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
3,11,trust,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
4,11,trust,In @Gfunkera86 we trust 🙏🏼
0,11,project,"23/ We do think that it is problematic when we don’t know the ulterior ideology/intentions of the founders, certainly when so much money is involved and all these opportunistic VCs and celebrities are blindly aping into this project. More clarity should be provided."

2,11,project,11/ Zagabond was asked about all the ICO scams and said: “you should at least have done as much work as you could have done on the project before trying to raise money”. Maybe he also forgot about that when raising money with his NFT projects and abandoning them. https://t.co/LfuM2qverZ
3,11,project,"2/ For those not already aware: we don’t have any affiliation with any NFT project or person and will report about anything and anyone. Contrary to most other “influencers” who are afraid to be cancelled, which partly explains why (self-)regulation is such a contentious subject."

0,11,transparent,"It takes a lot to build an #NFTproject. Most of it happens behind the scenes.

When TUS was born 4 weeks ago, we made a conscious decision to build in public and be transparent.

Introducing our🤠WEEKLY ROUND-UP🤠👇🏻🧵

#communitybuilding #queerlednft #womenincrypto #nfts"
1,11,transparent,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.
2,11,transparent,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
3,11,transparent,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
4,11,transparent,"@tothemaxy We've done several giveaways and we always screenshot the transfers. It's important to be transparent - especially in the crypto / NFT world.
Below are examples from two of our winners, who can vouch we're one of the good guys: @Charls020 &amp; @curioso_DR. 💚🦕 https://t.co/uDceOEim0x"
0,11,community,"6/ It shows that new incentive-based contracts are required. An example could be that 10% of all the mint money goes to the project founders, and 90% to a community wallet. Only after a milestone on the roadmap is met, a percentage of the money will be paid out to the founders."

4,11,community,"Of course @DoodlesCatsNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community, no website, nothing. When you have (serious) doubts about a project, avoid. https://t.co/ffwvprkZ9u"

4,11,nft,"It's interesting to see that @cerealclubnft deleted the 2 tweets about the involvement of 2 high level execs from SnapChat. The same Jeff Miller also promoted HypeBears, but deleted that message.

It confirms what we were already thinking...

0,11,team,"Yes, @AB84 is known to promote NFT projects for money and without doing any due diligence. He also tweeted about Vault of Gems, which was a complete scam by the same team that rugged many other projects.

1,11,team,"Just a quick retweet from the same group that created the Squiggles document. They also claim that @YogiesNFT that is minting in a couple of hours is a project/rug by the Squiggles team and have compiled a 171 document with proof/evidence.

3,11,team,1/ We are going to drop a nuclear bomb on @MetaMansionsNFT and this one is pretty wild. We have heard via a reliable source that the entire team went to Dubai to get UAE citizenship and avoid Canadian income tax. We believe this allegation to be credible. Why?
4,11,team,"Just a general warning for everyone. It has become clear that scammers have entered the NFT space at an industrial scale. The same anon teams churn out project after project with similar (stolen) art, paid Instagram/Twitter shills, high mint prices, etc. And they won't stop. https://t.co/KmrT8hEVlb"
