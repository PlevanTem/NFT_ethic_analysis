0,11,mint,"10/ We see messages about ""diversity"", but they probably do not realize that if you take out such a big amount of ETH out of the NFT ecosystem with a $100m mint, you are actually making this space less diverse. https://t.co/m9J3mxeJEn"

2,11,mint,"@BamAlegre_ We specifically mentioned that people that are new to the NFT space shouldn't mint any project, because they won't be able to make a proper distinction between legit and scam projects. Sometimes it's better to be safe than sorry."

We also recommend you check out @HoneyBadgesNFT, pioneering philanthropy to fund change-makers across the globe."
4,11,mint,"1/ Another day, another rug pull. This time Lazy Lion Ape Club - 626 were minted for 0.08 ETH each yesterday, so that is 50 ETH profit.

3,11,dev,Just heard about the @Blockverse_NFT rug. The project sold out yesterday in less than 8 minutes (500 ETH) and had 792 ETH in secondary sales. Discord &amp; website closed and the anon devs are gone. Do we need a federated entity that approves all NFT projects and its doxxed founders?
4,11,dev,"@diverse @023 We have asked some legitimate questions and leave it up to others to judge whether they find your answers satisfactory. We have more info about the other founder (who also lost his IG verification) and his GF, and about your dev Praj that was associated with the banned @NFT IG. https://t.co/flasygWtMY"
0,11,active,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
1,11,active,"3/ The Discord automatically censors anyone that mentions your real name and you also proactively ban people with critical questions. Both censoring and blocking people is not part of the true spirit of Web3, so why are you trying to become active in this space? https://t.co/fsTPtee47H"
2,11,active,"@artskooltourist @Friendswithyou The tweet served the purpose to show that they were ""reasonably early"" active in the NFT space and connected with many currently quite prominent NFT ""influencers""."
3,11,active,"3/ It's about influential nefarious actors that have either been exposed or haven‚Äôt yet been exposed but are currently still able to remain active and even expand their influence, buying into blue chip projects, and enjoy all the NFT perks that you can possibly imagine."
4,11,active,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."
0,11,trust,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"

4,11,trust,6/ Let‚Äôs start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
0,11,project,"16/ Many OG holders asking critical questions about the project were banned from the Discord. And when Beanie was asked whether he knew RGT, he denied ever having heard of it (see screenshots). But, in actual fact, it turns out he is the owner of RGT. https://t.co/rjhvuK8fyC"
1,11,project,"Glad to see increasingly more research being done into new and suspiciously looking projects such as @koonimalsnft. The web of social media influencers responsible for (promoting) many of these projects will gradually be unraveled.

2,11,project,"Last but not least - we have indications that ""scam projects"" are not only generating lots of money via mints, but also via fake collections using Discord messages and even moderators asking for your seed phrase. Do read this thread to protect yourself: https://t.co/KkYNV5saFU"
3,11,project,"Quite a few people have messaged us about our opinion of @fRiENDSiES_Ai and their Dutch Auction later today that could bring in over $100 million USD. They are afraid to speak out because this project is ""shilled"" by many big influencers. We will do a thread on this later today. https://t.co/goxQ1vnpsV"
4,11,project,There‚Äôs a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would do this without those people. üíñ
0,11,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
1,11,transparent,"‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

‚úî Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
‚úî Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
‚úî NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
2,11,transparent,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.
3,11,transparent,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
4,11,transparent,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
0,11,community,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.

2,11,community,"I think the entry of @NFTethics will make it difficult for people to be serial scammers. Suspicions will get reported by the community and @NFTethics will publicise findings.

It's really nice to see a lot of people get called and found out finally."
3,11,community,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions ‚Äúcommunity first‚Äù, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all."
4,11,community,"70/ If there is one community able to come up with a way to defy the traditional economic system and its laws, and find a solution for the natural tendency of resources to behave according to the Pareto principle, it is the NFT community."
