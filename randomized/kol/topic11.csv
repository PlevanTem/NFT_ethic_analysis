1,11,app,Cultural and social significance of something play huge roles in how we determine value. As does bias. These same concepts apply to digital items in an increasingly digital world.
2,11,app,"The response from @bapesclan to our thread was disappointing to say the least (screenshots and voice: https://t.co/FJxkkBiZo3)

Thanks to @Rug_Watch, also for finding a Covid-scam that another founder was involved in. He has deleted his tweet (as usual).

3,11,app,"There are apparently lots of new people in the NFT space since February, because the video that is going around has already long proven to be completely fake and fabricated. We have never taken any money from anyone in any shape or form and never will.

4,11,app,"Mark Cuban apparently received the following question at NFTLA: “What happens to the middle men getting cut out with all these new systems that put the creators in charge?”

His answer: “Fuck ‘em. Who cares.”

Unfortunately he was the middleman with @NFT.

1,11,bold,"13/ We came with a bold warning a week ago for NEW people not to mint any project for 2 weeks. We received a lot of criticism for that, but because of so many tips that we received, our “opinion” was well-informed (in our opinion). Again, it’s always a trade-off. https://t.co/ZJJQ6GZQvi"
2,11,bold,"The existence of LGBTQ+ people can't be legislated away!

TUS is founded by Paff &amp; Han, a lesbian couple that looks to help others fight inequality, live boldly and be their authentic selves.

Why the world needs more diverse leaders 👇🏽🧵 https://t.co/6aGnTH3KLd"
0,11,agree,"4/ They use the influence that they have as leverage to get what they want. If you don't agree they will use their influence to make sure your project doesn't succeed. When Ayroeth sold his Bored Ape, he continued to use it, until he was called out. His bio still mentions BAYC. https://t.co/gQ0Z0RQuer"
1,11,agree,"@Chodan_Bakri Respectfully, I disagree. A huge amount of incredible work doesn’t do well because of implicit bias and the unequal representation of genders within the space. Until we reach that equality, more effort needs to be put into amplifying underrepresented groups."
2,11,agree,"@Tako_Unik @LinkedIn We completely agree - we need more women across all aspects of the NFT Community! Especially women who hold other marginalised identities that can offer even more diversity - trans women, women of colour, Black women! 🤝"
3,11,agree,"67/ We urge people with large influence in the NFT space, particularly those who do this anonymously, to behave ethically and remind them that if they don’t, they will be found (out). Beanie surely agrees given that he ran an online reputation management company https://t.co/ENFfWKkOEN"
