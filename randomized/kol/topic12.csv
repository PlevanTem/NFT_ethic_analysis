0,12,capable,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility 🤝💖"
0,12,arm,"@NFTherder We specifically mentioned that people NEW to the NFT space shouldn't mint any project, because they won't be able to make a proper distinction between legit and scam projects. If they would do that, it would harm the NFT space far more long-term than our short term warning."

3,12,arm,@camolNFT @itstylersays @farokh @tropoFarmer @ElectionDayMad1 We will try to cancel so many nefarious actors in this space so that we ultimately will also be able to cancel ourselves.
4,12,arm,"No surprise here as well. @TFGmykL is known for creating lots of fake hype, clout farming, and then ditching the project. First @ApeKidsClub, then @NFTMTG (and @bapesclan), and soon his own avatar project. 

We might do a big Fortnite/esports NFT thread.

1,12,chill,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
