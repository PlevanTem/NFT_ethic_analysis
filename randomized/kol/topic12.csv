0,12,love,"Marc Andreessen (a16z) talks a lot about how much he loves ""free speech"" on Twitter, but when the Saudi government ordered Khashoggi's assassination for exercising his free speech, Marc remained on the advisory board of NEOM, a project worth $500 billion and declined any comment. https://t.co/YIcn47IjHF"
1,12,love,"1/ Sometimes a picture says more than a thousand words: @pmarca and his VC friends all around Mohammed bin Salman in 2016. We love to see these hypocrites talk about “free speech”, but they are happy to take tens of billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/s3usZZtGUx https://t.co/tlIETgVdmI"

3,12,love,"13/ Via an interview, we learn that he got introduced to crypto via his friend Linda Xie, herself a very early and well-connected crypto investor who used to work for AIG and then joined Coinbase. She also loves Azuki, but it gets more interesting. Audio: https://t.co/Kox1LDhwqJ https://t.co/4WzcYQcykH"
4,12,love,"Dear Amir - no problem. We noticed that many of your former companies were all compulsory struck off the companies' register (see the below four, but also others such as Diamont Ltd). Accountants are important in real life. 
Anyway, lots of love back.❤️

0,12,come,"25/ It starts to become a space created by unethical people for unethical people. We have many powerful/unethical enemies, but we have even more powerless/ethical friends. We have used this account to protect that latter category against the former. Nothing more and nothing less."
1,12,come,6/ We will update this thread further when more information becomes available. In the meantime we hope that all people involved are enjoying their cereal breakfast this morning!
2,12,come,"12/ There can be a cultural disconnect. In Europe, everyone who has one failed business is basically not taken seriously anymore, while that is the complete opposite in the US. You have to have a couple of failures to be taken seriously and you can even become US president."
3,12,come,"10/ If this issue is not soon being taken care of, it will only get worse and these nefarious actors only get more influence and become more intertwined with the NFT ecosystem. And one day you wake up and realize Big Tech was not even that bad."
4,12,come,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
0,12,year,14/ There is one Twitter source that predates BAYC by more than a year and another source from an academic William Allchorn who recently wrote a book “Moving beyond Islamist Extremism”. We have provided their explanations in the screenshots below. https://t.co/YAmMwtVbqP
1,12,year,"17/ But it gets worse: The Block posted an article a couple of years ago about the connection between Coinbase, 0x Labs and Scalar Capital. They have removed that article, maybe because Mike Dudas now has his own fund backed by a16z. https://t.co/y3mXpKseMJ"
2,12,year,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"

2,12,make,"4/ Another one that we recognize is Justin Taylor from Twitter, who changed the name of his wallet to not make it so obvious that it’s him, but it could explain why he had some “insider information” regarding the Meebits: https://t.co/EdquBC8qv0 https://t.co/7qyiu2P5A9"

Instead of making diversity, inclusion and accessibility a utility, let's make it norm.

0,12,change,4/ Did you know that technically a16z is not a VC anymore? They changed a couple of years ago to a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). Little wonder the powerful VC lobby group the NVCA has been talking to the SEC into changing its definition of what constitutes a VC firm. https://t.co/aI9DAmhl00
1,12,change,"4/ Initially he admitted that he didn't have any experience with crypto, but later he suddenly changed that story to suggest he has 4 years of crypto experience. And it was at that time he had a Crypto VIP group that he charged $1500 USD for some of his ""alpha"". https://t.co/Q2Iy5JWQ3i"
2,12,change,"GM to 1900 Changemakers!

We appreciate every single one of y’all. Together, we build a future where diverse leaders can create real change for our communities💪🏽

3,12,change,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good

4,12,build,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust. This is a tactic that Beanie is well aware of and frequently uses."

1,12,community,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.

4,12,community,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as “learning experiences”) and trust the process (don’t ask any questions, but “trust us”). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN"

0,12,project,@ReeseW Welcome to NFTs Reece! I’m the founder of an NFT project @Deadfellaznft - other women and gender diverse folks in the space that I admire are @iamlirona @stephyfung @dielamaharanie @GlamBeckettArt @grelysian @NftFat @nftnofriends @cryptostacys and many more
1,12,project,"Dear @wizardofsoho - I see that you are tweeting a lot about others people's scams, but what about your own scammy/shady projects and behavior? Do you think that your employer or the more than 1.5 million people for which they manage pensions/health benefits would be impressed?"
2,12,project,"7/ Fun fact 1 – even Serena Williams’ coach of 10 years, Patrick Mouratoglou, is now an NFT/Crypto expert. He raised over a million with a project that he seems to have rugged, but he will come back in 2023 with a new coin. We can’t wait for this crypto guru to change the world. https://t.co/tMnt659PKx"
3,12,project,"We already mentioned earlier that there is a thriving business in selling/buying (verified) Twitter accounts with many followers. It's also very easy to buy (fake) followers to give the impression that there is demand for certain projects.

4,12,project,"We need a non-profit advertising service that applies some level of due-diligence on the projects it promotes with standardised and transparent fees. 

All profits go to charity. 

I'd work on this for free if people are interested hmu."
0,12,trust,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

https://t.co/ElH2kNiN7t"
1,12,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
2,12,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
3,12,trust,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
4,12,trust,"❓❓❓ How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.
