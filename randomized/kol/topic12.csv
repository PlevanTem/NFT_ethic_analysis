Everyone dislikes centralization until you realize that it allows many to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the collective freedom at the expense of the individual."

4,12,love,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."

2,12,year,"Today @SerpentAU says that he was never banned from Fortnite. Almost two years ago he said he was banned.

4,12,year,There is a reason why none of the true NFT experts and influencers on Twitter (active for more than a year) have never ever heard of or mentioned many projects. They are only advertised via paid spam/scam accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Check your project and who promoted it.

1,12,project,"Yes, @AB84 is known to promote NFT projects for money and without doing any due diligence. He also tweeted about Vault of Gems, which was a complete scam by the same team that rugged many other projects.

3,12,project,Of course @hypebearsclub never responded. They count on people that are only active on Instagram and ban anyone who calls them out.

3,12,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, ‚Äútrust the process‚Äù implies the team knows what they‚Äôre doing."
