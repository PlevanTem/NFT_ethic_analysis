1,make,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"

3,make,"9/ When looking at Zagabond’s digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ"

0,change,"You can’t escape the thought that Yuga Labs changed the Dutch Auction to a flat price of 305 ApeCoin, because they were afraid that the DA would go down to a level that wouldn’t allow Marc Andreessen to purchase yet another house. He already bought 3 houses, so 5 more to go: 305. https://t.co/EKk6UuwwoW"
1,change,"3/ We can understand the logic behind it, and also we are fallible to the same “flaw”. When we report something, we might be 95% “right” but there could be collateral damage. You can’t check each &amp; every detail (certainly not with NFTs) and these details can also change over time"
2,change,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
3,change,3/ These individuals often get their credibility from the fact that they (A) have a lot of followers and (B) their PFP is considered to be very reputable (e.g. BAYC/CryptoPunk). Below are some examples of such persons (they frequently change their Twitter handles). https://t.co/oeQv8eafgv
4,change,"8/ An example is the below person. We had a mountain of evidence, but decided to test if a warning would help. Of course he didn’t respond to our “warning”, but we received indications that he changed his behavior and became a bit more careful. https://t.co/x6IMZttMYj"
0,transparency,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."

1,project,"2/ It remains strange to us that many that are planning to spend 0.5 ETH on any project, don’t seem to do any research at all. If someone on the street asks you to give him/her $1300 USD as an investment into something, wouldn’t you do any proper due diligence?"
