0,fund,8/ Someone did an analysis and tracked exactly where the funds went. Thanks @magicienmaartre. But it gets worse ‚Äì far worse. Why do you think @NFT promoted certain projects so much? https://t.co/Fn88TYLdl3
1,fund,"3/ Jason Falovitch (@jf_nft) together with Aaron Avruskin (@0xAA_NFT) were the co-founders of @NFT and @Leverage with Mark Cuban and Jason (""Mr. NFT"" lol) posted a thread with his side of the story, 21 days after the original thread by @topshotfund: https://t.co/GsIWemPI87 https://t.co/hhSK9fUgmA"
2,fund,"3/ It turns our Murtaza Akbar is from the UAE, but who is ""Nural Capital""? It's a fund just started by Rabia Iqbal (and backed by Kenetic) who used to work for Dubai's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, an investor in SoftBank's Vision Fund, which also invests in Animoca Brands. https://t.co/YtwFkvqYUK"
3,fund,"3/ Also the former Head of Marketing of TikTok, @atsignnick, knew about it, and his wallet was used to fund another wallet that bought Meebits. He seems to have been fired from TikTok earlier this year for ‚Äúgoing rogue‚Äù. https://t.co/4s8ngqAiY7"
4,fund,"2/ Liberty City also led the funding round for Animoca Brands, but they were also leading the funding round of a controversial Facial Recognition Firm called Clearview AI (not very Web3!). The elusive founder of Liberty City, Murtaza Akbar, is even on the board. https://t.co/KuD0Dbpfgg"
0,logo,"3/ They post fake pictures with GaryVee, where they have photoshopped the logo Metasneakers on the white shirt. This project is supposed to mint in 2 days, but don't do it. It's a scam and they will continue to try to find new ways and techniques to deceive you. https://t.co/UmrtmKaz7p"

2,logo,"15/ We dived a bit deeper in the history of this, especially since the skull on that t-shirt seems to have some resemblances with BAYC‚Äôs logo and because Yuga Labs and ‚ÄúRiding the Kali Yuga‚Äù could also seem to be related."

0,address,30/ They recently had a giveaway but the wallets that they mentioned as being the winners of that giveaway were made-up wallet addresses ‚Äì they don‚Äôt exist on the blockchain. https://t.co/6dO6ftTcFI
1,address,"53/ The investment vehicle that he used for TokenPay was Huntingdon Investment Corp, registered on the British Virgin Islands on the same address as TokenPay. The address is also included in the Panama papers. The whitepaper mentions the how critical this ""partner"" was. https://t.co/TF6TU1Mcck"
2,address,"25/ It was probably meant to create the illusion that CryptoBet or ChimpBet have a proper gambling license, because when we checked the status, it seems to be a sub-license of another company, of which there is no trace. The address is associated with another (gambling) company. https://t.co/MLVBeX5h6V"
3,address,"2/ In real life, certain identifying data (name, (tax) ID, bank accounts, ‚Ä¶) can be compared to blockchain addresses. Based on (combinations of) that data everyone is able to trace our historical actions and it allows scrutiny over our personal and professional lives."
4,address,"If we want true diversity in #web3, we have to address the real world barriers that stop people from getting here, first. A thread üßµ

3,need,"QG was focused on providing support such as funding for skills building &amp; education, inclusive housing &amp; medical aid, gender affirming care and more. 

Because queer POC need those wellbeing needs met before they can become diverse leaders in the first place."
4,need,"@Chodan_Bakri Respectfully, I disagree. A huge amount of incredible work doesn‚Äôt do well because of implicit bias and the unequal representation of genders within the space. Until we reach that equality, more effort needs to be put into amplifying underrepresented groups."
0,connect,"15/ These projects either have the same (or connected) founders or are based on playbooks that you can purchase in the in the ‚Äúcriminal circuit‚Äù. How to earn easy, quick and large amounts of money with NFTs anonymously? This playbook shows you how."
1,connect,"13/ This is a project with artists that have the right connections, but have not necessarily shown to have a track record in the NFT space, and the roadmap is also very vague, or even non existent. It will all be soon revealed and also will depend on what the community wants. https://t.co/DY47Kt7rJX"
2,connect,"1/ Recently we mentioned about the connection between CerealClub and HolyCows, a project that used to be a rug, but is now under fully new ownership.

We can now reveal that HolyCows has received $200.000 USD and signed an NDA to keep this confidential.

3,connect,"The Web3/NFT space can be regarded as a microcosm of the VC world based on the right connections, buying low &amp; selling high, over-hyping and lots of phony philanthropy &amp; fake positivity.

1,trust,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because ‚Äúthere's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn‚Äôt think that that would also apply to the ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"
2,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, ‚Äútrust the process‚Äù implies the team knows what they‚Äôre doing."
3,trust,"Btw, I'd strongly recommend learning to use @flipsfinance. We're gonna put out some tutorials on it soon but I would really really recommend getting proficient at it; trust me you'll want to!"
4,trust,"RIP Metabots. This isn't the first rug pull and won't be the last. Find a dev team you trust, and make sure the art isn't stolen! We could do with an overall ""background"" check of artwork of all recent collectibles tbh."
0,wallet,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
1,wallet,"7/ The TRUSTH score associated with your wallet and listed on every NFT marketplace will become more important than anything, and people buying NFTs from wallets with a low TRUSTH score will see their own score immediately decrease significantly."
2,wallet,30/ They recently had a giveaway but the wallets that they mentioned as being the winners of that giveaway were made-up wallet addresses ‚Äì they don‚Äôt exist on the blockchain. https://t.co/6dO6ftTcFI
3,wallet,"12/ They use a lot of different wallets to obfuscate all the transactions, but this transaction of 449 ETH was from one project alone. So how much did they rake in from all the other projects? https://t.co/mKc7DnWN9u"
4,wallet,We noticed that 449 ETH was sent from the Apes in Space wallet to another wallet that is associated with @NFT and via that wallet 145 ETH was sent to Aaron Avruskin and even more to Jason Falovitch via different other wallets. https://t.co/9TW0bQ7xOx
