0,13,essay,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

1,13,essay,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
2,13,essay,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
3,13,essay,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
4,13,essay,"❓❓❓ How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.

0,13,account,"5/ We wonder what methods they used to get their IG account so quickly from 0 to 1.7 million, but as always, there is much more that doesn’t seem to have been mentioned yet. If you ever wonder why no one publicly responds to our threads, that is the reason. There is always more! https://t.co/cJoDrKc5zM"
1,13,account,47/ Also a TokenPay entity in Hong Kong was created (again behind a proxy) that was used to dump 2.5 million TPAY coins on the market in exchange for hundreds of valuable domain names that went to personal accounts. The value of the TPAY coin would never recover after this. https://t.co/4spkTiuvvh
2,13,account,"6/ It is well-known that the Big Four accountancy firms are involved in writing many governments’ tax policies that favors wealthy individuals and corporations, which are their main clients. Without some gray areas, accountants would not be able to make money. https://t.co/PXfM589uSd"
3,13,account,"1/4 Twitter has become the primary vehicle for scammers to get attention for their NFT project. Many of us will quite quickly be able to see whether a Twitter account belongs to scammers or not, in the same way that most people are quickly able to identify email spam."
4,13,account,"Just for the avoidance of doubt. The verified account @BhawanaCAN is an obvious scam promoting an ""Ape Coin airdrop"" and also the verified account of @ToddWasserman has been hacked and used for scamming.
Almost nothing is what it seems, and if it seems too good to be true, it is. https://t.co/skw6d6jnFi"

3,13,help,"20/ Many influencers &amp; artists don’t care about where the money is coming from or is going (hint: LooksRare). As long as they make money and people buy their art for enormous amounts, they are happy to say how great and beneficial NFTs are. Changing the narrative sometimes helps. https://t.co/GaDdk4UlFs"
4,13,help,"@0xQuit Many people are often not able to predict in advance which projects are ""going to help us build"", certainly not when the founders are undoxxed. Less or no money upfront means less incentive to scam, and almost no liquidity drain. Now it's 0% risk for founders, 100% for holders."

4,13,nft,"It's interesting to see that @cerealclubnft deleted the 2 tweets about the involvement of 2 high level execs from SnapChat. The same Jeff Miller also promoted HypeBears, but deleted that message.

It confirms what we were already thinking...

0,13,trust,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
1,13,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
2,13,trust,"20/ And he mentions that people especially trusted @NFT because of Mark Cuban’s name on the page and the blue verified account. They tried to remove his name after this scandal came out, but the screenshots were already taken. https://t.co/r1aX2fNcf9"
3,13,trust,You can always trust @beaniemaxi to not miss out on a good trade 🧠
4,13,trust,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"

2,13,hacked,"2/2 When confronted with that, he said that his account was hacked by someone else and that he didn't have anything to do with it. In December the kind soul @Zeneca_33 already wrote a thread about him. Shame that a small minority makes us all less trustful https://t.co/EYdquGmTg4"

1,13,wallet,"5/ Some other insiders were “smarter” and decided to create new wallets to purchase lots of Meebits in advance of the announcement, including:
0x2efe6e9b127679f158718c1ea296f0ad9120c50a

2,13,wallet,"3/ Also the former Head of Marketing of TikTok, @atsignnick, knew about it, and his wallet was used to fund another wallet that bought Meebits. He seems to have been fired from TikTok earlier this year for “going rogue”. https://t.co/4s8ngqAiY7"
3,13,wallet,"6/ It shows that new incentive-based contracts are required. An example could be that 10% of all the mint money goes to the project founders, and 90% to a community wallet. Only after a milestone on the roadmap is met, a percentage of the money will be paid out to the founders."
4,13,wallet,30/ They recently had a giveaway but the wallets that they mentioned as being the winners of that giveaway were made-up wallet addresses – they don’t exist on the blockchain. https://t.co/6dO6ftTcFI
