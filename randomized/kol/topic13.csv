3,13,essay,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
4,13,essay,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."

2,13,account,"1/3 These large Twitter accounts are all part of the same (invisible) cartel involved in scamming people by promoting rugs.

3,13,hacked,"Just for the avoidance of doubt. The verified account @BhawanaCAN is an obvious scam promoting an ""Ape Coin airdrop"" and also the verified account of @ToddWasserman has been hacked and used for scamming.
