0,13,compass,"My take on people defending @larvalabs is that they are either too emotionally attached to their bags and are in denial, or are too wayward on the moral compass to agree that what they did was wrong."
1,13,compass,"15/ Also with his current company he has shown that his moral compass is not pointing in the right direction, but if you have a net worth of over $13 billion, not many people are able to stand up against someone with so much money and influence. Some successfully did however. https://t.co/bMVmDsxA8b"

1,13,central,"The “Blockchain” is in some way an oxymoron, as no one can be blocked from it. We are thinking about the concept of the “Lockchain”: digital detention in a decentralized prison guarded by an authority-resistant authority. If you are in the Lockchain, you can't use the Blockchain."
2,13,central,"4/ This is short list of the richest people in crypto. It does not feature the 2 billionaire founders of OpenSea and others. Ask yourself the question how it's possible that so much money is ""centralized"" to only a few people in this ""decentralized"" world.

3,13,central,4/ We have heard various people say that this is simply the “dark side of decentralization” and it’s just “part of the game”. But we believe that might well be a logical fallacy. Let’s give some examples.
4,13,central,"Everyone loves decentralization until you realize that it allows some to ""abuse"" their individual freedom at the expense of the collective.

Everyone dislikes centralization until you realize that it allows many to “enjoy” the collective freedom at the expense of the individual."
0,13,alpha,"20/ Talking about the BAYC founders – yesterday ""Gordon Goner"" provided some alpha about RTKFT, but he did not mention that a16z funded that project as well. https://t.co/bW44KKqnYo https://t.co/fv1MFlMexx"
1,13,alpha,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"

3,13,alpha,"4/ Initially he admitted that he didn't have any experience with crypto, but later he suddenly changed that story to suggest he has 4 years of crypto experience. And it was at that time he had a Crypto VIP group that he charged $1500 USD for some of his ""alpha"". https://t.co/Q2Iy5JWQ3i"
4,13,alpha,"22/ Transparency pervades all domains and each person will be asked to provide certain basic input such as your wallet addresses, disclosures about (financial) relationships with (past/future) projects, alpha groups and/or other influencers (and their wallets)."
0,13,art,"22/ It makes it even more shameless to see that in Scalar Capital’s pitch deck, they explicitly mention that they bought 0x at $0.048. Fun fact: Coinbase just announced 0x Labs as their NFT partner and the price of ZRX skyrocketed. https://t.co/l5KMkEr67F"
