1,14,buy,I’m going to gift two women or gender diverse people a @CleverGirlsNFT and @sad_girls_bar each tonight so they can begin collecting/trading. Maybe you’re just starting out or have barriers to buying in. No explanations needed just drop your wallets below.

3,14,buy,"23/Imagine being a billionaire and trying to rip off poor teenagers by deceiving them into buying worthless JPEGs with their only/small savings? And not taking any responsibility for it, not feeling even ashamed of it, but going on stage and pretending to be a reputable NFT guru. https://t.co/KoeIWqrdrk"

0,14,like,"All these Web3 influencers that constantly promote scam projects seem to forget that they have become the replacement of the Web2 giants that they all so dislike. 

Their behavior is however infinitely worse and opportunistic than all of BigTech together.

1,14,like,"13/ If you are consistently showing opportunistic, selfish and unethical behavior (large amounts of wash trading, lots of TornadoCash’ing, lots of WL/minting abuse, lots of undisclosed paid ads revenue streams, etc, etc), your TRUSTH score will likely be low."
2,14,like,"Everyone loves decentralization until you realize that it allows some to ""abuse"" their individual freedom at the expense of the collective.

Everyone dislikes centralization until you realize that it allows many to “enjoy” the collective freedom at the expense of the individual."

0,14,sell,"9/ We have received confirmation from multiple independent sources that Marc Cuban's @NFT venture offered equity to projects that had the potential to sell out.

2,14,sell,"We already mentioned earlier that there is a thriving business in selling/buying (verified) Twitter accounts with many followers. It's also very easy to buy (fake) followers to give the impression that there is demand for certain projects.

0,14,eth,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"
1,14,eth,"@NFTethics I think I learnt about the value of decentralisation AFTER being in crypto. It opened my eyes to things that I though were just normal or okay, narratives that have been set by those that want power."
2,14,eth,"24/ Are there no good people? Of course, there are. The majority is good, but as we already mentioned before this space favors the least ethical and most immoral persons, and they are productive and dominant in this space. And it influences others to behave unethically as well."

4,14,eth,13/ What does this all show? That not many people or organizations in a decentralized and unregulated space are able to responsibly and ethically use the power that they have been given by others.
0,14,price,"1/ CerealClub that is minting today is a scam. Associated with Squiggles and having a mint price of 0.5 (via a Dutch auction going to 0.1), which worst case would net the project &gt;$11 million USD. Team is completely anonymous and https://t.co/AHW8mTkmwV"
1,14,price,"The behavior of @elonmusk is similar to many Web3 influencers. First FUDing Twitter by suggesting things are wrong and he might create a new social media platform. He creates leverage &amp; buys the dip. Stock price goes up &amp; he can use the platform to shill.
https://t.co/S480vCYNk8"
2,14,price,"If you have 0.5 ETH to invest in NFTs, you are generally far better off to spread your risks by investing that amount into 4 to 10 undervalued old(er) projects than into one new project with minting prices higher than 0.25 ETH plus gas wars. That's worse than gambling."
3,14,price,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.

4,14,price,"5/ There is much much more, but do note that if the price of ETH or ApeCoin is a bit volatile in the coming weeks/months, it might be that one of the VC's execs or any of their LPs are buying a couple of 9 figure houses somewhere. All for the culture of course. https://t.co/fAI79idG9z"
