1,rich,"The beauty of Web3/crypto/NFTs is that it connects the poor with the rich, the naifs with the cynics, the moralists with the crooks, the loyalists with the opportunists and they all pretend they and you are winning. Their ideology is based on hypocrisy, immorality and ignorance."
2,rich,"It's not uncommon that ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up rare items for cheap. Recently even the son of the 3rd richest person in the world was accused of this.

Be careful with @StarcatchersNFT and @BokiNFT.

3,rich,"4/ This is short list of the richest people in crypto. It does not feature the 2 billionaire founders of OpenSea and others. Ask yourself the question how it's possible that so much money is ""centralized"" to only a few people in this ""decentralized"" world.
https://t.co/eqstvBqeeH"
4,rich,19/ Counties such as Canada are happy to welcome rich people from Iran using the “no questions asked” policy. This is just one example – we could have equally mentioned many other countries but it’s just to make the point that many countries have similar policies. https://t.co/32G89Oljjw
0,moon,"1/ Some people contacted us to ask our opinion on @moonbirds_xyz that is minting tomorrow for 2.5 ETH, which would take out more than 75 million USD out of the ecosystem. As usual, many are afraid to speak out because they don't want to offend ""powerful"" Web3/NFT influencers/VCs. https://t.co/YXvAqs8mwn"

2,moon,"4/ This example highlights the issue of “perverse incentives”. Founders get most of the money during the minting process when the project is only based on “hype”. This continue during the “honeymoon period”, when still a lot of things are promised and OS royalties are flowing in."
3,moon,"@NFTethics @moonbirds_xyz I’m gutted because when you first came into the scene you wrote good shit and it was a real prevention mechanism for future scammers. 

Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It’s a shame really."
4,moon,"13/ Your thoughts on @moonpay's ""concierge service"" that seems to provide celebrities with free bored apes while providing the illusion to the outside world that they really paid for them would also be most appreciated.

0,eth,"On the Twitter page and website of @WeatheReportNFT, they mention that ""a storm is coming"".

Not sure if they were referring to the document that the artist just released about this project, but it doesn't look good (or ethical).

1,eth,"2/ “in the interest of TRANSPARENCY, the winners can choose whether or not they wish to be revealed publicly”. Don’t be surprised if the winners don’t want to be revealed and the siblings of the founders are all suddenly driving in lambos. https://t.co/AkqA3OMBWp"
2,eth,4/ We noticed that some Bored and Mutant Apes have been transferred (for free) to MoonPay’s OS account from different other accounts including (for example) @nft42_/@j1mmyeth’s OS account. Can you clarify why that is the case and how these people have been compensated? https://t.co/AwVJmutf9t
3,eth,"More than 3 months ago, the ratio of well intentioned projects and bad intentioned ones was probably around 80%-20%. 

That ratio has in our view shifted: 80% are now likely scams and 20% are projects that really want to build something.

This makes sense:
https://t.co/8CZaqzAiRj"
4,eth,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

1,trust,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"

3,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
