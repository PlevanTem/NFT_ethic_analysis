As long as they make money and people buy their art for enormous amounts, they are happy to say how great and beneficial NFTs are. Changing the narrative sometimes helps. https://t.co/GaDdk4UlFs"

3,14,buy,4/ On their website they seem to have (purposely) left out the mint price for the NFT on the question how to buy one. The ETH price has gone a bit down but they would still net 500 ETH (over $13 million USD). https://t.co/u7MFvCdlfy
4,14,buy,"We already mentioned earlier that there is a thriving business in selling/buying (verified) Twitter accounts with many followers. It's also very easy to buy (fake) followers to give the impression that there is demand for certain projects.

2,14,worth,"So one of the founders of @LarvaLabs (LL) sells all 40 of his V1 Punks less than a week ago (for 260 ETH) via a 2nd wallet, and then LL releases an official statement that they are worthless.

2,14,sell,"1/ We received quite a lot of requests to look at @metamansionsnft, which is minting later this week. The mint price alone (0.88 ETH) is already a red flag, but there are many more. They are doing a “giveaway” of 888 ETH (10% of the mint profit) but only when it sells out AND…"

0,14,price,"We simply have to all agree that we don’t mint any project with mint prices &gt;0.1 (ideally lower). It will disincentive scammers to go for cash grabs, will keep more liquidity in the NFT/ETH ecosystem and will create more innovation in this space (e.g. performance-based contracts)"
1,14,price,"5/ There is much much more, but do note that if the price of ETH or ApeCoin is a bit volatile in the coming weeks/months, it might be that one of the VC's execs or any of their LPs are buying a couple of 9 figure houses somewhere. All for the culture of course. https://t.co/fAI79idG9z"
