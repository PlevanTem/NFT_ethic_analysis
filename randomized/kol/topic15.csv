0,15,auction,"5/ We have seen the auction at Christie's a couple of days ago of 9 mint passes from Friendswithyou that all sold for a lot of money. But when you dive into these transactions, you see that all these accounts that bought them for &gt;30 ETH are all in some way (inter)connected. https://t.co/bNKhXfE3kd"
1,15,auction,"1/ CerealClub that is minting today is a scam. Associated with Squiggles and having a mint price of 0.5 (via a Dutch auction going to 0.1), which worst case would net the project &gt;$11 million USD. Team is completely anonymous and https://t.co/AHW8mTkmwV"
2,15,auction,"Welp, trust me to have the ""rekt city"" auction end on terrible day for the market.

Current bid is 16.5ETH, ends at 5PM EST today!"
0,15,afraid,"2/ For those not already aware: we don’t have any affiliation with any NFT project or person and will report about anything and anyone. Contrary to most other “influencers” who are afraid to be cancelled, which partly explains why (self-)regulation is such a contentious subject."
1,15,afraid,"1/ Today we learned that putting out publicly available and correct information is considered to be unethical. It was not negative news, but still people immediately perceived it like that, and started to attack the “messenger”, afraid that it might affect the value of their NFT."
2,15,afraid,"Quite a few people have messaged us about our opinion of @fRiENDSiES_Ai and their Dutch Auction later today that could bring in over $100 million USD. They are afraid to speak out because this project is ""shilled"" by many big influencers. We will do a thread on this later today. https://t.co/goxQ1vnpsV"
3,15,afraid,"You can’t escape the thought that Yuga Labs changed the Dutch Auction to a flat price of 305 ApeCoin, because they were afraid that the DA would go down to a level that wouldn’t allow Marc Andreessen to purchase yet another house. He already bought 3 houses, so 5 more to go: 305. https://t.co/EKk6UuwwoW"
4,15,afraid,"1/ Some people contacted us to ask our opinion on @moonbirds_xyz that is minting tomorrow for 2.5 ETH, which would take out more than 75 million USD out of the ecosystem. As usual, many are afraid to speak out because they don't want to offend ""powerful"" Web3/NFT influencers/VCs. https://t.co/YXvAqs8mwn"
0,15,brings,"The anonymity that the use of these pfps brings can also provide safety and empowerment for marginalised people, while also creating an equal playing field for folks to interact without pre-existing bias spilling in."
0,15,actual,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
1,15,actual,"10/ We see messages about ""diversity"", but they probably do not realize that if you take out such a big amount of ETH out of the NFT ecosystem with a $100m mint, you are actually making this space less diverse. https://t.co/m9J3mxeJEn"
2,15,actual,"Even when you think everything with a project is going well - it's still possible that things are wrong with the underlying smart contract and that the art/metadata is actually centralized on a website that is about to expire. A technical rug?

3,15,actual,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of “democracy” to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
4,15,actual,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.
