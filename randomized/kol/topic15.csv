3,15,trust,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"
4,15,trust,"Why scammers &amp; fraudsters thrive? Research shows that people tend to default to trusting others over distrusting them, believing them over doubting them and going along with someone‚Äôs self-presentation rather than embarrassing them by calling them out. https://t.co/KAu7BQh7JG"

2,15,day,"The project @DeluxeGoat is 99.9% a scam (also minting today). Founders have 0 and 1 post on IG.
