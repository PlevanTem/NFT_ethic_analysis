3,15,ada,64/ He also mentioned that the Canada Revenue Agency are ‚Äúretards‚Äù and ‚Äúmuch too dumb‚Äù for crypto. The reason why he still has his Canadian citizenship is because they would otherwise audit him. https://t.co/QiXp0EAGmZ
4,15,ada,"It's not uncommon that ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up rare items for cheap. Recently even the son of the 3rd richest person in the world was accused of this.
