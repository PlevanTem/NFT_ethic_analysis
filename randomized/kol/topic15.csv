1,year,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"
2,year,"10/ With the Russia-Ukraine war, we can see the grander scale of the hypocrisy that has always existed and how many of these countries have benefited for years by taking on ‚Äúdirty‚Äù money from rich individuals. https://t.co/ufJnFzhIPa"
3,year,"2/ And thread 2 (which mentions that their ""biggest client is @reshadeth a 15 year old""). It involves (in)direct proof of identity fraud, getting around KYC/AML laws, wire fraud, giving and/or receiving capital assets to a minor which legally cannot invest

3,love,"1/ Sometimes a picture says more than a thousand words: @pmarca and his VC friends all around Mohammed bin Salman in 2016. We love to see these hypocrites talk about ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù, but they are happy to take tens of billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/s3usZZtGUx https://t.co/tlIETgVdmI"
4,love,"3/ This (former) ""Trailer Park Kid"" seems to love it all. His background is quite similar to many ""Web3 influencers"". The best ""Tinder/Twitter swindlers"" across the globe have united and they are all active in crypto/NFTs. They have all it takes to make it in this space. WAGMI! https://t.co/LM39p887uS"
0,month,"3/ Nima often posts about Dubai on IG, but the most important evidence is from another co-founder, who is still very young and he mentioned on Twitter last month ‚ÄúLiving in Dubai feels like living in the Metaverse‚Äù. The post was liked by his mother and other co-founders. https://t.co/YnSfJnre3N"
1,month,"6/ The Bored Ape that Gwyneth Paltrow announced to have received via MoonPay on 26 Jan 2022 was already purchased by MoonPay more two months earlier (15 Nov 2021). Does that imply that MoonPay is actively investing in NFTs, even before a potential celebrity wants to purchase one? https://t.co/PzV9G84pIZ"
2,month,"5/ There is much much more, but do note that if the price of ETH or ApeCoin is a bit volatile in the coming weeks/months, it might be that one of the VC's execs or any of their LPs are buying a couple of 9 figure houses somewhere. All for the culture of course. https://t.co/fAI79idG9z"
3,month,"18/ This whole story is made even worse when you see an interview that Jason Falovitch did a couple of months ago. Not sure why he is filmed in something that looks like a prison cell, but maybe he is preparing for what is coming. https://t.co/XoPfu2lzG8"
4,month,"More than 3 months ago, the ratio of well intentioned projects and bad intentioned ones was probably around 80%-20%. 

That ratio has in our view shifted: 80% are now likely scams and 20% are projects that really want to build something.

This makes sense:

0,ago,4/ Did you know that technically a16z is not a VC anymore? They changed a couple of years ago to a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). Little wonder the powerful VC lobby group the NVCA has been talking to the SEC into changing its definition of what constitutes a VC firm. https://t.co/aI9DAmhl00
1,ago,"Today @SerpentAU says that he was never banned from Fortnite. Almost two years ago he said he was banned.

Today he says that ""there was no violation of the terms of services"", but two years ago he was even dropped by his own organization Overtime Gaming.

3,ago,"5/ We have seen the auction at Christie's a couple of days ago of 9 mint passes from Friendswithyou that all sold for a lot of money. But when you dive into these transactions, you see that all these accounts that bought them for &gt;30 ETH are all in some way (inter)connected. https://t.co/bNKhXfE3kd"
4,ago,"13/ We came with a bold warning a week ago for NEW people not to mint any project for 2 weeks. We received a lot of criticism for that, but because of so many tips that we received, our ‚Äúopinion‚Äù was well-informed (in our opinion). Again, it‚Äôs always a trade-off. https://t.co/ZJJQ6GZQvi"
