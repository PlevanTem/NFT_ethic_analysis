1,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."

1,source,16/ We also have confirmation from multiple sources that the @NFT team and the Squiggles team (a team involved in many rugs) exchanged “staff members” (via Luxury Equities by Ali S. and Gavin M.) so it’s all far less innocent and much more connected/orchestrated than it looks.

2,user,"We also hope @Twitter creates a feature that allows any user to see by whom they have been blocked. When logged into this account we can't access certain tweets/discussions, so it creates transparency (like the blockchain), which is a key feature of Web3.

3,user,"If Twitter is creating a feature that will allow users to edit their tweets, can they also create a feature to show any deleted tweets.

There is often more truth hidden in deleted tweets than in the manipulation and deception found in anything published.
