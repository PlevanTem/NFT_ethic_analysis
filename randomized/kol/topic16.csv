0,16,make,"17/ That is of course not the case ‚Äì these founders that earn tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars with all these scam mints want to remain anonymous for obvious reasons. And they have sufficient funds to make that possible."
1,16,make,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.
2,16,make,There was a time when everyone in the Web3/crypto/NFT space was supporting each other with a common goal to make this tech more mainstream. But now our paths are diverging and we are all playing musical chairs. It's a beautiful interplay between human cooperation and competition.
3,16,make,"2/2 When confronted with that, he said that his account was hacked by someone else and that he didn't have anything to do with it. In December the kind soul @Zeneca_33 already wrote a thread about him. Shame that a small minority makes us all less trustful https://t.co/EYdquGmTg4"
4,16,make,46/ A TokenPay entity in Switzerland was created (as usual behind a proxy) and stakes were bought into a real estate bank that didn‚Äôt make any profits. They also acquired 7% of a public company stock called Naked Brands (which has not been sold yet). https://t.co/ZLcPfM844W
0,16,saying,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F

2,16,saying,"3. I keep saying this but curse of knowledge cognitive bias is definitely steering me to be cautious; whereas this time last year being a newbie I was going gung-ho, as I would be if I was a newbie rn. 

So let's see, hopefully my caution is not needed."
3,16,saying,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We are not saying that, but we do hope that more experts like you do a deep dive into all those similarly looking and advertised projects that minted in the past week and are about to mint that are all connected. Could potentially be the biggest ""heist"" in NFT history."

2,16,bad,"We were hesitant to post stories by women that have had bad experiences with Crypto888crypto, but we can share the below anonymous story and there are many more. Our post was not so much about the upcoming project, but about the person: ""Angel #888"".

2,16,trust,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust. This is a tactic that Beanie is well aware of and frequently uses."
3,16,trust,"Yes, @swipathefox rugged a project, because he didn't have any time. Should have thought about that before starting it.

2,16,like,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds).
