3,16,make,"More than 3 months ago, the ratio of well intentioned projects and bad intentioned ones was probably around 80%-20%. 

That ratio has in our view shifted: 80% are now likely scams and 20% are projects that really want to build something.

This makes sense:

So let's see, hopefully my caution is not needed."

0,16,people,"History will judge very hard on big social media influencers on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc., pretending to be reputable and reliable, for selling a young generation of naive and easily influenced people worthless NFTs for tens of millions of dollars."
1,16,people,"1/ This is going to be a bit of a controversial thread, so just some disclaimers. We are free speech maximalists and “truths” can be inconvenient or politically incorrect, which could make them to certain people “offensive”, but it doesn’t make them less “true”."

3,16,people,"Imagine you are IRL a criminal, crook or conman. And 99% of people know that, so that you can only scam 1%.

And suddenly you hide behind a JPEG, and 99% of people think that you are great, and only 1% knows your shady past.

Some people are laughing all the way to the bank."
4,16,people,"65/ We still have far and far more information that we have not (yet) disclosed, but we think we have presented enough evidence to allow people to make up their own judgement as to the kind of person that Beanie (really) is."
0,16,bad,"5/ It would explain why they spent so much money on traveling and also why the whole team had to go there. It also shows bad intent, because if the funds were going to be re-invested, it wouldn't be taxable income. https://t.co/vbGfHbgLUr"
1,16,bad,2/ Most people active in the NFT space have now (finally) seen the amount of bad actors that are very active/productive and they manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways. The most problematic is when they continue to remain or become more influential in this space.

3,16,bad,Imagine that anyone in the world forwards you emails from their spam folder and asks you whether that email is legit or not. That is exactly how our inbox looks like. Lots of new people in this space that are not aware that lots of bad actors have joined the NFT space as well.
4,16,bad,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately “survive”, so the current state of the market is that “bad news” for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
0,16,trust,"❓❓❓ How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.

1,16,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
2,16,trust,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

3,16,trust,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust. This is a tactic that Beanie is well aware of and frequently uses."
4,16,trust,"Scammers are out in full force today. Quadruple check every link. Don’t trust ANYONE, not even your wife. Don’t look anyone in the eye. Be vigilant at all times. Question everything. Protect yourself."

2,16,like,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
3,16,like,"@MrMuankana @larvalabs They said they are (1) ""not official Cryptopunks"", (2) ""we don't like them and we've got 1000"" and (3) ""so draw your own conclusions"". For someone reading between the lines that means basically ""worthless"". They should have released the statement before dumping them on others."
