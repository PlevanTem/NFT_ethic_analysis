0,17,ape,15/ But guess what? He was picked up by Kungarna - for which two of the founders of Bapes are working. https://t.co/XnaR8FPUb0
1,17,ape,"There are apparently lots of new people in the NFT space since February, because the video that is going around has already long proven to be completely fake and fabricated. We have never taken any money from anyone in any shape or form and never will.

2,17,ape,9/ Yesterday was another Spaces with Bapes ambassadors. They all talk as if this project is the best thing since sliced bread. Zero self-reflection or a warning to people that don‚Äôt know anything about NFTs that the value of most NFT projects will go to 0. https://t.co/T7bXYTnw9D
3,17,ape,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."

0,17,bonus,Additional bonus thread by someone else: https://t.co/EHtPxa6o5D
0,17,additional,"1/ We will still provide some additional information on Azuki. Zagabond himself said that he expects to be doxxed at some point and that that is fine, so we will do that. For storytelling &amp; learning purposes of course, and to create a bridge between the physical &amp; digital world. https://t.co/ZVN2PYUJOW"
1,17,additional,"It is indeed very plausible that someone who used to be completely anonymous decides to ruin his own reputation in the most damning way possible by doxxing himself via an alt account in order to gain additional credibility with that new account.

2,17,additional,"1/ Before our upcoming thread about VCs, we thought it would be good to first give some additional background to further understand the context and connections that we will be making. It‚Äôs a simplified version for brevity purposes."
3,17,additional,"4/ We already mentioned earlier that social media platforms have allowed their main assets, the large influencers and ""celebrity"" accounts to get away promoting all kinds of scams. And they all benefit massively from the additional engagement."
4,17,additional,"8/ We asked Moonpay and its CEO many questions on 28 January 2021 and had an additional observation a couple of days later. Since 28 January, the CEO has not been on Twitter anymore and never responded. https://t.co/XWmcNoAo2I"
0,17,adding,"@CoachP1421 @MetaKryptVault Just to let you know that we have also been blocked by this person, even though we had never heard of this account before (and never reported about them). Maybe Twitter needs to consider adding an option that shows by which persons we have all been blocked (for transparency). https://t.co/SHJPIonToy"
1,17,adding,"@ethcapitalmaxi Most of the tweets were written out, but you always have to change a couple of things to make sure it fits Twitter's character limitation. The other time-consuming task is adding around 100 attachments (it's on average 4 per post)."
