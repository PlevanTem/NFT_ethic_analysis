3,17,sold,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
4,17,sold,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"

1,17,today,"@NFTherder @youbekindtoday FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out."
2,17,today,"Of course UnscratchedNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community (5 tweets), banning people, empty promises, etc. https://t.co/QRFCOa4Q7m https://t.co/j0lpRJmXG9"
3,17,today,"Yes, @MutantXApe (minting today) is a scam. Undoxxed team, empty roadmap, Twitter account with 24k followers in 1 month, closed Discord with 100k members, and their AMA on YouTube was also made private. Apparently they used actors to feature in that AMA.

Saturday reminder that what's for you, won't go past you. Trust the process✨"
2,17,process,2/2 - We did however not see Beanie/GM Capital listed as a formal investor on any of the publicly disclosed funding rounds. Would you be willing to clarify if/how he invested in Hyype and if you are in the process of disassociating from him after his exposure?
3,17,process,Trust the process💚💖 https://t.co/0yEpkgHdXA
4,17,process,It was a brilliant strategy from Yuga Labs. Let all the poor souls sell off their NFTs from other projects so that they could purchase (305) ApeCoin at the top and then create a “high gas” minting process which only the “rich &amp; influential” could afford. Win-win in true VC style.
0,17,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
1,17,trust,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"

3,17,trust,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
4,17,trust,@phuktep @JaymesWestfall @DeezeFi @dsphoto1985 This is bullshit. Deeze is one of the good guys and genuinely just loves the banter of collecting NFTs. I'd trust him with my unborn children.
