When Ayroeth sold his Bored Ape, he continued to use it, until he was called out. His bio still mentions BAYC. https://t.co/gQ0Z0RQuer"
1,17,sold,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"
2,17,sold,"8/ And with regard to another founder, @ryancarson, there are quite some articles about how Treehouse (his former company) laid off close to 90% of its staff without severance pay, while he sold a mansion for over $3.2 million and bought a boat. Anyway, it's all about priorities. https://t.co/7fjK6xYShL"

4,17,sold,"22/ So if you see Mark Cuban on the stage, always remember that he is only a billionaire because he sold Audionet/Broadcast.com to Yahoo, which is considered the worst internet acquisition of all time. So he is used to selling worthless stuff to naïve “fools”. https://t.co/i3D0DxJ4uL"

Two days ago Jared Kushner received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia for his new VC. His brother is an investor in @yugalabs.

0,17,process,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
