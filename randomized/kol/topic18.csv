1,18,community,"Of course UnscratchedNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out.

4,18,community,"What is impossible IRL is possible in the NFT world. Two @CowgirlsNFT are dating 2 @pudgy_penguins (all founders) and they took advice from @ColeThereum how to drain wallets. No joke and we hope they fix this for the community. Full story from the head mod

0,18,user,"We also hope @Twitter creates a feature that allows any user to see by whom they have been blocked. When logged into this account we can't access certain tweets/discussions, so it creates transparency (like the blockchain), which is a key feature of Web3.

There is often more truth hidden in deleted tweets than in the manipulation and deception found in anything published.

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent.

2,18,fair,@Ape7068 @psych_nft You would prefer me to ask women not to reduce men to their marital status to be fair despite it not being a thing? Assuming equality doesn’t make it so. Men’s accomplishments are never eclipsed by their marital status.
3,18,fair,"We wonder when Sam Bankman-Fried is going to change the last 2 vowels in his surname with 2 other ones that better reflect his MO. The fact that he dresses the way he does is probably a subtle reference to Andersen’s fairytale ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".

0,18,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
1,18,transparent,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk

4,18,transparent,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
0,18,data,"11/ The person in question is Beanie (Twitter handle: beaniemaxi) and we have confirmed his identity via different independent sources. Any evidence provided is from publicly available data and can be verified, in the true spirit of Web3."
1,18,data,"2/ We were alerted by other individuals that provided us with an extensive Excel spreadsheet with 24 tabs full of wallet transactions that had an overlap with the other information. Thank you @tylengyel, @rugpullfinder &amp; others for your work on this. We verified the data provided"
2,18,data,"Even when you think everything with a project is going well - it's still possible that things are wrong with the underlying smart contract and that the art/metadata is actually centralized on a website that is about to expire. A technical rug?

https://t.co/3yi82PAf5L"
3,18,data,"2/ In real life, certain identifying data (name, (tax) ID, bank accounts, …) can be compared to blockchain addresses. Based on (combinations of) that data everyone is able to trace our historical actions and it allows scrutiny over our personal and professional lives."
4,18,data,"38/ The case was however dismissed because Beanie allegedly made a deal and sold out all his thousands of paid customers, incl. admins/mods of his forum by handing over all their personal data to the authorities. They all faced criminal charges and were fined. https://t.co/WBPkeK2mvo"

0,18,way,Full transparency: we had full belief and intention the reveal would happen when we said - the massive amount of variance proved to be a way larger job to sign off than anticipated. The collection is amazing. It will reveal within the next day when the team has slept.
1,18,way,"6/ In this podcast, one of the founders mentions that they are great because “we always surround ourselves with incredible people” (1:10:10), but if you look at the history of some of the ambassadors, you have to wonder how/why they exactly are selected. https://t.co/qDFyIqDH2c"
2,18,way,"3/ This is not the best way of using our time. Many scammers, fraudsters, thieves and criminals IRL are behaving in the same in the digital world, so it only confirms what most will already know. There are also too many to report about."
3,18,way,"1/ We already mentioned earlier that in a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. And they brag about it as well, so we are posting 2 threads that confirm that point. Thread 1:

4,18,way,You can always trust @beaniemaxi to not miss out on a good trade 🧠

1,18,trust,"Scammers are out in full force today. Quadruple check every link. Don’t trust ANYONE, not even your wife. Don’t look anyone in the eye. Be vigilant at all times. Question everything. Protect yourself."
2,18,trust,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
3,18,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
4,18,trust,"Welp, trust me to have the ""rekt city"" auction end on terrible day for the market.

Current bid is 16.5ETH, ends at 5PM EST today!"

1,18,transparency,"@Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts It's just an innocent question. Web3 is all about transparency, so we are curious why the tweets are protected. Nothing more."
2,18,transparency,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are “dedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication”. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2"
