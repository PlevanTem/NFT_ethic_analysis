0,18,cautious,"3. I keep saying this but curse of knowledge cognitive bias is definitely steering me to be cautious; whereas this time last year being a newbie I was going gung-ho, as I would be if I was a newbie rn. 

So let's see, hopefully my caution is not needed."
0,18,collective,"Everyone loves decentralization until you realize that it allows some to ""abuse"" their individual freedom at the expense of the collective.

Everyone dislikes centralization until you realize that it allows many to “enjoy” the collective freedom at the expense of the individual."
1,18,collective,"We’ve got a lot of new followers lately, so allow us to reintroduce ourselves 👋🏽

3,18,collective,"3/ Also nepotism is completely standard in the NFT space, so the fact that GaryVee (Gennady), his brother AJ, Beeple and some old friends received the Proof collective for free is standard. We saw quite a lot of other ""old"" friends that received the proof collective for free/$3. https://t.co/o20NOgfIM4"

0,18,advisor,"Marc Andreessen (a16z) talks a lot about how much he loves ""free speech"" on Twitter, but when the Saudi government ordered Khashoggi's assassination for exercising his free speech, Marc remained on the advisory board of NEOM, a project worth $500 billion and declined any comment. https://t.co/YIcn47IjHF"
1,18,advisor,"20/ The 2 Scalar Capital founders were heavily involved in developing Coinbase’s listing procedures along with an engineer (Maksim Stepanenko), who was an advisor to Scalar. The sudden manner in which Coinbase listed 0x (price climbed up 17% within an hour) attracted suspicions. https://t.co/eaposggJkZ"
2,18,advisor,"If scammers are found out or if none of the things they promised came true, they always come up with the same excuses: they have been hacked, they didn't know X, Y or Z, they were only advisors/mods, they didn't check things, they have a hard time, etc.

3,18,advisor,"5/ If you want to get backed by VCs and/or a corporate brand, you can’t have any skeletons in the closet and it’s possible that that was the reason for Azuki to “come clean”. They added R. Hatoyama as an advisor, who is also venture partner at Sozo Ventures, investor in Coinbase. https://t.co/gkSFonTvsR"
4,18,advisor,"15/ Indeed, a16z's Marc Andreessen &amp; Chris Dixon personally, but also the 2 co-founders of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, who after that started his own VC Paradigm, and became an advisor to 0x Labs. 0x Labs is a non profit org, but raised $70m from Coinbase &amp; Co. https://t.co/BGz3SOC5u7"

0,18,clothes,"9/ When looking at Zagabond’s digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ"
0,18,combined,"7/ This space consists of many (com)passionate communities, creative creators, committed contributors, compulsive collectors, combined with colossal quantities of crypto capital, and as such is and remains a force to be reckoned with."
1,18,combined,The business model of VCs is that the best investment in a successful fund/venture equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund/ventures combined. It’s the same with NFTs and this Web3 model is now brought into the lives of ordinary people. The implications are far-reaching.
2,18,combined,"1/3 This time a positive shout-out to a true OG, the once number 1 CryptoPunk V1 &amp; V2 holder for over 2 to 3 years, @soldthebottom, who just returned 2 punks that he exploited in June 2017 to their original owner with a combined value of $70k. https://t.co/KLA9wJaHtf"
