0,space,Of course @hypebearsclub never responded. They count on people that are only active on Instagram and ban anyone who calls them out. Minting day is the finish line for these projects and it's sad that naive people will pay a big price entering the NFT space https://t.co/JvhxUb7JsR https://t.co/Hmzqg7BrnZ
1,space,"@PastelPersons @garyvee @elldeeNFT Agreed! Just look how much effort has gone into this NFT! All Gary's favourite things! I can personally vouch for Pastel Persons; a truly beautiful, ethical project with some of the best women in the NFT space. üíöü¶ïü¶ñ"
2,space,"1/ Not many people (pretended to have) understood our short thread from yesterday, but it confirmed how incestuous and hypocritical this space has become. So far we have seen 0 efforts and incentives for measures to keep people safe from nefarious actors. https://t.co/Ge1p6H6ZiV"
3,space,"15/ This is not a Dutch Auction in the true sense of the word and certainly not when the earlier you buy, the more rare your NFT will be. It is however an example of how the NFT space works: a few ""insiders"" are hyping ventures/projects/artists, and they benefit the most."

0,said,"5/ That said, it was probably inevitable. Too many people already knew and then it just takes one person to spill the beans and it becomes a matter of when and not if this is going to happen. That is why we recently provided the following recommendation: https://t.co/SsYNaT7Hj9"
1,said,Full transparency: we had full belief and intention the reveal would happen when we said - the massive amount of variance proved to be a way larger job to sign off than anticipated. The collection is amazing. It will reveal within the next day when the team has slept.
2,said,2/ Of course Mark Cuban said that he didn‚Äôt know about it (many billionaires are immoral hypocrites that pretend to be blissfully ‚Äúignorant‚Äù about unethical aspects of their own companies). See @coffeezilla‚Äôs short video for more background: https://t.co/klVDF5XWUz https://t.co/H6BCpyVISM
3,said,"Today @SerpentAU says that he was never banned from Fortnite. Almost two years ago he said he was banned.

Today he says that ""there was no violation of the terms of services"", but two years ago he was even dropped by his own organization Overtime Gaming.
https://t.co/LU5iCGqFsu https://t.co/ajCtP26p9n"
4,said,"We said it before, but for people new(ish) to the space, there is simply no justification to ask millions upfront by undoxxed, unproven teams with nothing than some fancy JPEGs and fake influencers promoting it.

Mint price for many past projects was &lt;0.1

0,community,"70/ If there is one community able to come up with a way to defy the traditional economic system and its laws, and find a solution for the natural tendency of resources to behave according to the Pareto principle, it is the NFT community."
1,community,"Of course UnscratchedNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community (5 tweets), banning people, empty promises, etc. https://t.co/QRFCOa4Q7m https://t.co/j0lpRJmXG9"
2,community,"Transparent, on chain verifiable, tamper proof - this is how we build a safer community."
3,community,"9/ Any new projects that will be created will have to have the wallets and TRUSTH score of their founders listed, and if the founders ‚Äúrug‚Äù the project, either they will see their TRUSTH score getting very low or they can refund/compensate the community."
4,community,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
0,fuck,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
1,fuck,"19/ In that interview he mentions that he doesn‚Äôt do it for the money, but that he ""fucking"" loves the work that he does, and also that almost any of the deals/projects listed on @NFT came to him in some capacity. https://t.co/tHrRTznLtV"

‚úî Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
‚úî Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
‚úî NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
1,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
2,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
3,transparent,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don‚Äôt believe in gatekeeping. 

Here‚Äôs a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] üßµüëáüèΩ"
4,transparent,"We need a non-profit advertising service that applies some level of due-diligence on the projects it promotes with standardised and transparent fees. 

All profits go to charity. 

I'd work on this for free if people are interested hmu."
0,honest,"19/ If an account has a lot of engagement from ‚Äúfake‚Äù followers or ‚Äúbots‚Äù via inorganic, fraudulent, or dishonest means its score will be low. In the future further weighing can be given to accounts that have shown to be more ‚Äútruthful‚Äù than others."
1,honest,"@SerpentAU The whole gaming/esports scene is completely corrupt(ed) and many of those people are currently active in the NFT space. All pretending to be honest (you exposed Kquid for cheating), but you turned out to be the biggest cheater yourself and denied it first. Very hypocritical. https://t.co/yvanUeMPPX"
2,honest,"We see lots of messages that seem to suggest that in Web3 you can be whoever you want to be. 

Lots of people in this space pretend to be honest, authentic and altruistic, but they are often insincere, fake and selfish. 

Real are the machinations of manipulation and deception."

0,people,"20/ When we deal with (anon) people that we only know via digital interactions, we often fill in the things we don‚Äôt know in the most favorable way we imagine. We project our own fantasies to fill in the blanks, which is part of the reason why good people are so often scammed."
1,people,"If you have a large audience in this space, you have a moral responsibility to work by a code of ethics that has people‚Äôs best interests in mind. Transparency or gtfo."
2,people,"56/ TPAY and TokenPay Suisse AG were transferred to RGT, and many people involved in the ""TPAY scam"" were already well aware of that. The latest Medium post by TokenPay (https://t.co/XNyNNoxwoZ) is that new updates can be followed via RGT and so we have come full circle. https://t.co/qcH7hxCMKM"
