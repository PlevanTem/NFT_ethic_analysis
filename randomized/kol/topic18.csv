0,18,community,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
1,18,community,"7/ We see a lot about community, but only specific people that are part of that community can respond to certain messages (see below). https://t.co/p1KoThRIve"
2,18,community,"13/ This is a project with artists that have the right connections, but have not necessarily shown to have a track record in the NFT space, and the roadmap is also very vague, or even non existent. It will all be soon revealed and also will depend on what the community wants. https://t.co/DY47Kt7rJX"
3,18,community,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
4,18,community,"2/ People feel especially betrayed by the fact that only 30 ETH was left in the community fund for further development, while 90 ETH in total seemed to have been paid to some of the moderators. The founders seem to have left the project with more than 1700 ETH."
0,18,user,"❓❓❓ What solutions does TrustVibes offer? 

✔ Trust Vibes is a decentralized platform. All payments on the platform are done using the #TRUST token. This token is used for the fair distribution of resources and rewards on the platform and to stimulate users of TrustVibe. https://t.co/vxw1sMSGJI"
1,18,user,"If Twitter is creating a feature that will allow users to edit their tweets, can they also create a feature to show any deleted tweets.

There is often more truth hidden in deleted tweets than in the manipulation and deception found in anything published.

4,18,user,"We also hope @Twitter creates a feature that allows any user to see by whom they have been blocked. When logged into this account we can't access certain tweets/discussions, so it creates transparency (like the blockchain), which is a key feature of Web3.

0,18,fuck,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."

0,18,fair,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
1,18,fair,"Was just informed I was added to this list. Blocked, not expending energy on it. Striving for equality and inclusivity isn’t ‘wokeism’. I’m fairly up front with who I am and how I work, if that doesn’t align with how you live, you’re welcome to just not engage with me. https://t.co/0Yv66lPZ4T"
2,18,fair,"We wonder when Sam Bankman-Fried is going to change the last 2 vowels in his surname with 2 other ones that better reflect his MO. The fact that he dresses the way he does is probably a subtle reference to Andersen’s fairytale ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".

1,18,transparent,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."
2,18,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
3,18,transparent,@NateAlexNFT My favourite thing is how it’s not a transparent GIF so when the sun sets and Twitter goes to dark mode I can see the outlines
4,18,transparent,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk
0,18,data,"2/ One of the reasons why we decided to release the information is that we had serious doubts about the existence of his investment fund.

0,18,way,"Normally scam projects gain in 2 major ways. First via all the mint money (and royalties), but secondly because the scammers sell off all their free/cheap NFTs they got from the WL sale off on OS during the initial hype for a lot of money. We are breaking that business model."
1,18,way,"10/ We know a lot of the true identities behind all the NFT aliases, but writing threads such as the one about Beanie are very time-consuming. And selecting only one individual to highlight and expose will always be arbitrary, because why that person and not the other one?"

0,18,trust,"RIP Metabots. This isn't the first rug pull and won't be the last. Find a dev team you trust, and make sure the art isn't stolen! We could do with an overall ""background"" check of artwork of all recent collectibles tbh."
1,18,trust,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"
2,18,trust,"❓❓❓ How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.

3,18,trust,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
4,18,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."

1,18,transparency,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don’t mint. It’s quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."
2,18,transparency,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2"
