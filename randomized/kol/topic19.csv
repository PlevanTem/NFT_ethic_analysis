‚úî Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
‚úî Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
‚úî NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
1,19,god,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don‚Äôt mint. It‚Äôs quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."
2,19,god,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2"

4,19,love,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."

1,19,shill,"The NFT space basically consists of two worlds: 

1. Experienced investors that use Twitter/reputable contacts for their info. 
2. Inexperienced naifs that get their info from paid shills at Instagram.

They never talk about or even mention the same projects."
2,19,shill,"Just a general warning for everyone. It has become clear that scammers have entered the NFT space at an industrial scale. The same anon teams churn out project after project with similar (stolen) art, paid Instagram/Twitter shills, high mint prices, etc. And they won't stop. https://t.co/KmrT8hEVlb"

3,19,binance,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."

1,19,wrong,"20/ But this will require further evaluation as ‚Äútruth‚Äù is a social construct that is (more) difficult to algorithmize.

2,19,wrong,"If ""influencers"" tell you how great a project is and you don't understand that, please note that they are the experts because they know the founders personally and you are just an ignorant idiot. But if you mint it's your own fault if it goes wrong. WAGMI!
