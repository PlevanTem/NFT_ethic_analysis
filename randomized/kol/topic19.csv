‚úî Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
‚úî Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent.

2,19,god,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are ‚Äúdedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication‚Äù. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2"

4,19,god,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."

0,19,shill,"The behavior of @elonmusk is similar to many Web3 influencers. First FUDing Twitter by suggesting things are wrong and he might create a new social media platform. He creates leverage &amp; buys the dip. Stock price goes up &amp; he can use the platform to shill.

1,19,shill,@smkzzzz Please check our tweets in the past days. There are so many and they all look the same. Same playbook. Some paid Instagram/Twitter accounts that shill them.
2,19,shill,"9/ We also see a lot of messages about generosity, altruism and friendship, but that applies especially to the true friends of friendsies who received free mints and have to shill this ecosystem ""powered by love, good vibes, and friendship"". https://t.co/2t0vkIJ0Xc"

0,19,binance,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."
1,19,binance,@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We simply wanted to make people aware of this fact. We have noticed lots of new people joining this space that are very naive. It is not uncommon for the funds to be distributed to non-anon accounts or accounts with a history. As said - we look forward to seeing what happens.

4,19,wrong,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

0,19,crypto,"In real life, everyone's identity and their ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù are generally public information, but not their private financial transactions.

0,19,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
