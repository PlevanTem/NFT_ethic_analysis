3,20,world,"It's not uncommon that ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up rare items for cheap. Recently even the son of the 3rd richest person in the world was accused of this.

Be careful with @StarcatchersNFT and @BokiNFT.

Since the beginning, systems have been designed to intentionally exclude and underserve BIPOC &amp; LGBTQ+ people.

That's why we're excited to share this collective. Take Up Space:"
0,20,talk,"Marc Andreessen (a16z) talks a lot about how much he loves ""free speech"" on Twitter, but when the Saudi government ordered Khashoggi's assassination for exercising his free speech, Marc remained on the advisory board of NEOM, a project worth $500 billion and declined any comment. https://t.co/YIcn47IjHF"

3,20,talk,Women and gender diverse folks as the main post instead of the after-thought comment thread. Ty for coming to my TED talk.
4,20,talk,4/ Did you know that technically a16z is not a VC anymore? They changed a couple of years ago to a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). Little wonder the powerful VC lobby group the NVCA has been talking to the SEC into changing its definition of what constitutes a VC firm. https://t.co/aI9DAmhl00

We are redefining leadership in web3. A force demanding diversity, equity &amp; inclusion for those intentionally left behind.

The next generation of diverse leaders are here!🌈✊🏽 https://t.co/bb3tyYhRmY"
0,20,community,"@saxyjacky Co director of a creative production agency servicing large corporations for things like visuals, videos, games etc. Then also a community organiser for women and gender diverse people to receive connection and mutual aid."
1,20,community,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
2,20,community,"NEW ARTIST Welcome to the #TrustVibes Family, Singer &amp; Composer @EuCaioCortez 🎶. Last year Caio's music was streamed over 31K times to 18.4K Listeners on @spotifyartists. We look forward to helping him build his community in the #TrustVerse. 🚀🤙#BinanceSmartChain $TRUST #NFTs https://t.co/cj9P3CiaF0"
3,20,community,"Transparent, on chain verifiable, tamper proof - this is how we build a safer community."
4,20,community,"9/ Any new projects that will be created will have to have the wallets and TRUSTH score of their founders listed, and if the founders “rug” the project, either they will see their TRUSTH score getting very low or they can refund/compensate the community."
0,20,diverse,I just went Encryptas shopping and would like to gift a couple to women or gender diverse folks that might not be able to access them. I would like you to NOMINATE someone just starting out in the space in the comments &lt;3 https://t.co/egpn16GJFz

4,20,diverse,"QG was focused on providing support such as funding for skills building &amp; education, inclusive housing &amp; medical aid, gender affirming care and more. 

Because queer POC need those wellbeing needs met before they can become diverse leaders in the first place."
0,20,people,"3/ The Discord automatically censors anyone that mentions your real name and you also proactively ban people with critical questions. Both censoring and blocking people is not part of the true spirit of Web3, so why are you trying to become active in this space? https://t.co/fsTPtee47H"
1,20,people,"1/ For those people asking why we always come up with ""FUD"" on projects on mint day. We generally have never heard of any of these projects, but we receive currently about 200 DMs per day. We had received between 5-10 about CerealClub and actually more than 5 about Bunny Buddies."
2,20,people,"Adding to this, collections that provide a diverse spectrum of gender representation within their traits will also do well. The future of this space is inclusive and diverse, the real world isn’t 75% men but people of all genders."
3,20,people,"Another big thread about @0xHustler and the project @SavePlanetEarth that is minting later today. It shows once again the dubious ""track records"" that certain people have and how they try to benefit from naive individuals that blindly trust ""charities"".

https://t.co/vZYRumffLc"
4,20,people,@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We simply wanted to make people aware of this fact. We have noticed lots of new people joining this space that are very naive. It is not uncommon for the funds to be distributed to non-anon accounts or accounts with a history. As said - we look forward to seeing what happens.

1,20,web,"2/ Your website used to show that Doctor Troller (AKA Andrew Brown) used to be one of the 2 (co-)founders (Scar). His name is now conveniently removed, but in the current Twitter profile of @0xonslaught it still says that he is a co-founder, meaning that there is also another one https://t.co/Qpx3X31Lkd"
2,20,web,"The story about @Farokh &amp; @tailopez is actually worse. Tai was a client of Farokh's company Good Life and he was mentioned on multiple websites as a reference client (just like GaryVee). Tai's name has now been removed, but the screenshots are still there.

4,20,web,"To achieve true diversity in #web3, we need to prioritise onboarding BIPOC, LGBTQ+, disabled, neurodivergent &amp; other underserved groups.

However, onboarding MUST go beyond simply setting up a wallet &amp; buying an NFT. 

Otherwise that’s merely profiting from the disenfranchised."

2,20,racism,"11/ And talking about ""diversity"": did you know that @friendswithyou both seems to think that BAYC is racist, but also has been accused of racism themselves? Well, the below attachments show just that. Life is ironic sometimes. https://t.co/CAVDiPPQcV"
3,20,racism,"3/ Some people have asked us, either publicly or privately, about our views on BAYC and especially regarding the potential “racism allegations”, to which the CEO of Yuga Labs has responded in the below interview (from 14:57 to 19:00): https://t.co/Zf9W0iBfRd"

0,20,space,"12/ To be fair to Beanie, he actually contributed in many ways to the NFT space. His tweets were intelligent and engaging about interesting projects, and nothing compared to what we currently see with scam rings using the “Follow, Retweet &amp; WL/Giveaway”, incentivized by greed."
1,20,space,"24/ This is partly because on Yuga Labs Pitch Deck, two of these persons are characterized as “minority partners”. We will also soon publish a similar sort of thread about the VCs involved in this space. That promises to be even more fun. https://t.co/yhM39v50Od"
2,20,space,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
