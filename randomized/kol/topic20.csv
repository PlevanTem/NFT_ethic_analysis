1,20,authentic,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
2,20,authentic,"We see lots of messages that seem to suggest that in Web3 you can be whoever you want to be. 

Lots of people in this space pretend to be honest, authentic and altruistic, but they are often insincere, fake and selfish. 

Real are the machinations of manipulation and deception."
3,20,authentic,"The existence of LGBTQ+ people can't be legislated away!

TUS is founded by Paff &amp; Han, a lesbian couple that looks to help others fight inequality, live boldly and be their authentic selves.

3,20,app,"2/ The evidence is provided in the attachments below - all published in their Discord. Nothing happened for months, and only after we tweeted about it, HolyCows was compensated. https://t.co/javJxSdrxb"
4,20,app,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.
0,20,coinbase,@cryptoisnice @balajis @coinbase We know and we therefore explicitly mentioned in the tweet that that picture dates back to 2018. Katie Haun also recently left a16z and both Asiff Hirji and Mike Lempres have also changed positions.
0,20,claiming,"Someone tweets that he got scammed by a person. Literally in less than a minute, there are 5 tweets from other scammers that try to scam this person again by claiming that they can provide ""help"". It has become a cynical world... https://t.co/iIUnZfgVq7"
1,20,claiming,"2/ No roadmap other than some abstract nonsense, and claiming they are backed by Fortune 500 companies, VCs, investors, traders, but of course there is 0 evidence of that. Claiming they will use the profits for charity as well - we all know that that means. https://t.co/ZqzEhddSYS"
