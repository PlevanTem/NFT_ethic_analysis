0,21,blockchain,"7/ We think @NFTherder might create a thread about Zagabond‚Äôs blockchain transactions (across the different projects that he was involved in), so we will focus on the IRL relationships. As we said before: https://t.co/l06l1l8clX"
1,21,blockchain,"5/ We call it TRUSTH and it stands for Transparency, Trust and Truth. Trust refers to your digital actions on the blockchain, Truth refers to your digital words on social media, and Transparency pervades both. They are all (inter)connected."
2,21,blockchain,"What happens to BAYC if all 10k Bored Apes have been bought by (bored) celebrities? They all try to become part of an exciting new community, but will gradually realize that it‚Äôs the same community that they are already part of. Good thing you can't photoshop the blockchain."
3,21,blockchain,"19/ Next on the list is a profile named ‚ÄúZLOVE11‚Äù. Via some blockchain transactions, an IG profile and a website, we were able to find this person‚Äôs identity, which could be a friend of one of the BAYC founders as he resides in Miami. https://t.co/pu20h0ZPCo"
4,21,blockchain,"12/ We also don‚Äôt want to punish people who happened to be ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
0,21,ownership,"1/ Recently we mentioned about the connection between CerealClub and HolyCows, a project that used to be a rug, but is now under fully new ownership.

We can now reveal that HolyCows has received $200.000 USD and signed an NDA to keep this confidential.

1,21,value,47/ Also a TokenPay entity in Hong Kong was created (again behind a proxy) that was used to dump 2.5 million TPAY coins on the market in exchange for hundreds of valuable domain names that went to personal accounts. The value of the TPAY coin would never recover after this. https://t.co/4spkTiuvvh

3,21,value,"14/ Once the algorithm is defined and tested, the idea is that everyone will receive their score which remains invisible for a few weeks. If you have a low score you can do nothing, but you risk the value of your NFT assets will go to 0 and not being part of the community anymore"
4,21,value,"Imagine a scenario of huge consolidation where 1 successful/rich NFT project buys up lots of other promising and undervalued NFT projects and then, after a year, decides to sell it all to Meta/Facebook, Microsoft or any VC. From Web 3.0 to REKT 4.0. Welcome to The Metaverse 19.84"

3,21,crypto,"@NFTethics I think I learnt about the value of decentralisation AFTER being in crypto. It opened my eyes to things that I though were just normal or okay, narratives that have been set by those that want power."
4,21,crypto,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We are not saying that, but we do hope that more experts like you do a deep dive into all those similarly looking and advertised projects that minted in the past week and are about to mint that are all connected. Could potentially be the biggest ""heist"" in NFT history."
0,21,investment,"@NFTherder @gmcapital_ One of the many reasons why we decided to release the information is that we had serious doubts about the existence of the investment fund. Apart from Beanie's background, the ISIN number did not match any database records and also consisted of 3 country code letters instead of 2 https://t.co/zmwVjhWWGf"
1,21,investment,"2/ Via the OpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received ‚ÄúNFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investments‚Äù. We confirmed that these are genuine (seed) investors. https://t.co/phDWGuGilG"
2,21,investment,"@arvinlolme @NFTherder Yes, in the thread he mentions that 3 months ago he made you aware of this and that nothing has been done yet. A bit more pro-activity wouldn't hurt don't you think? Certainly given the small investment it requires and the huge amount of primary/secondary sales in comparison."
3,21,investment,The business model of VCs is that the best investment in a successful fund/venture equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund/ventures combined. It‚Äôs the same with NFTs and this Web3 model is now brought into the lives of ordinary people. The implications are far-reaching.
4,21,investment,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
0,21,market,"2/ He bought a lot of NFTs at the top and when the market went down, he was allegedly $10 million under water. He manufactured a fake argument with Nifty Gateway (see article) and he then got into DMs with all artists he bought from https://t.co/WH48ZmfIBN"
1,21,market,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù, so the current state of the market is that ‚Äúbad news‚Äù for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
2,21,market,"Welp, trust me to have the ""rekt city"" auction end on terrible day for the market.

Current bid is 16.5ETH, ends at 5PM EST today!"
3,21,market,"5/ And then there is a Twitter Spaces with Nima Ghassemi, the main co-founder, who claims that he will use 50% of the budget for marketing. But at the same time he also claims he has a very successful marketing company generating $3 million a year. ü§°https://t.co/Cw3lzW26cQ https://t.co/Bn70BZ5zSn"
4,21,market,Gendered marketing sucks in general. It also totally disregards gender diversity and those that are gender fluid. Let‚Äôs just like what we like and fight against toxic gender roles üí™
0,21,asset,"2/ And thread 2 (which mentions that their ""biggest client is @reshadeth a 15 year old""). It involves (in)direct proof of identity fraud, getting around KYC/AML laws, wire fraud, giving and/or receiving capital assets to a minor which legally cannot invest

2,21,asset,"When you spend too much time solely on CT it's easy to forget how correlated crypto is to equities, other risk assets and sentiment. Just never see many people talking about it on my feed."
3,21,asset,"4/ We already mentioned earlier that social media platforms have allowed their main assets, the large influencers and ""celebrity"" accounts to get away promoting all kinds of scams. And they all benefit massively from the additional engagement."
