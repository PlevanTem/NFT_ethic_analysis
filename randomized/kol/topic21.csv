0,21,blockchain,"20/ Exposing Beanie was financially the worst decision that we could have personally made, but we did it and didn‚Äôt sell any NFTs before his exposure. We also never benefited from trading in NFTs in any way by using this account and the blockchain will provide that."
1,21,blockchain,"2/ In real life, certain identifying data (name, (tax) ID, bank accounts, ‚Ä¶) can be compared to blockchain addresses. Based on (combinations of) that data everyone is able to trace our historical actions and it allows scrutiny over our personal and professional lives."

3,21,blockchain,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.
4,21,blockchain,"12/ We also don‚Äôt want to punish people who happened to be ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
0,21,ownership,"1/ Recently we mentioned about the connection between CerealClub and HolyCows, a project that used to be a rug, but is now under fully new ownership.

We can now reveal that HolyCows has received $200.000 USD and signed an NDA to keep this confidential.

0,21,value,45/ Internal pump and dump schemes and very shady business deals and partnerships were suspected to have enabled a large percentage of funds to be siphoned off for personal gain while reducing the BTC value of the TPAY coin for its holders. https://t.co/9SkyygKEsQ
1,21,value,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1
2,21,value,"8/ Do you think it is appropriate for you, as the CEO of MoonPay, to have an avatar on Twitter with a (verified) Bored Ape when your actions/communications can have a material impact on the value of that NFT? https://t.co/0edkfO9BgH"
3,21,value,Cultural and social significance of something play huge roles in how we determine value. As does bias. These same concepts apply to digital items in an increasingly digital world.
4,21,value,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."

4,21,crypto,64/ He also mentioned that the Canada Revenue Agency are ‚Äúretards‚Äù and ‚Äúmuch too dumb‚Äù for crypto. The reason why he still has his Canadian citizenship is because they would otherwise audit him. https://t.co/QiXp0EAGmZ
0,21,investment,"@NFTherder @gmcapital_ One of the many reasons why we decided to release the information is that we had serious doubts about the existence of the investment fund. Apart from Beanie's background, the ISIN number did not match any database records and also consisted of 3 country code letters instead of 2 https://t.co/zmwVjhWWGf"
1,21,investment,"2/ Via the OpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received ‚ÄúNFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investments‚Äù. We confirmed that these are genuine (seed) investors. https://t.co/phDWGuGilG"
2,21,investment,"2/ It remains strange to us that many that are planning to spend 0.5 ETH on any project, don‚Äôt seem to do any research at all. If someone on the street asks you to give him/her $1300 USD as an investment into something, wouldn‚Äôt you do any proper due diligence?"
3,21,investment,The business model of VCs is that the best investment in a successful fund/venture equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund/ventures combined. It‚Äôs the same with NFTs and this Web3 model is now brought into the lives of ordinary people. The implications are far-reaching.
4,21,investment,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
0,21,market,"1/ We already mentioned earlier that in a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. And they brag about it as well, so we are posting 2 threads that confirm that point. Thread 1:

1,21,market,"3/4 This has resulted in a recent trend to either use previously legitimate Twitter accounts with lots of tweets and/or the use of verified Twitter accounts. You can buy these from different marketplaces, and we have seen a surge in demand for these. https://t.co/u9lkO8ezfs"
2,21,market,"2/ He bought a lot of NFTs at the top and when the market went down, he was allegedly $10 million under water. He manufactured a fake argument with Nifty Gateway (see article) and he then got into DMs with all artists he bought from https://t.co/WH48ZmfIBN"
3,21,market,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2"

3,21,asset,"10/ Of course only wallets with significant NFT assets and high TRUSTH scores may be deemed reputable enough to invest in (with or without doxed teams), so we don‚Äôt have to constantly assess each upcoming project and in particular all these scam projects."
