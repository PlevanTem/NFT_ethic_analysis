0,red,@wilxlee We just shared it again to emphasize its importance. Thank you for compiling it! Ideally we should also mention to new(ish) people what we think is a reasonable mint price to give them an indication of what is normal and historically common for successful projects.
1,red,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.

3,red,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
4,red,"The result? Every single TUS community member (or as we call them, Changemakers) is empowered to create change and become a leader in web3 and beyond. ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿

The utility is becoming the BEST version of yourself. 

Alongside the most diverse &amp; inclusive community in web3."
0,flag,"4/ This is in sharp contrast with the doxxing of the BAYC founders. Sure, they represent a high profile NFT project worth billions of dollars, but that is not enough of a justification to dox people when they themselves admitted that they didn't find ""any particular red flags"". https://t.co/XjJgfaz12x"

2,flag,"This is a must read for anyone, but especially for those that are new(ish) to the NFT space and are planning to mint any project today, tomorrow, or in the coming week(s). Be able to spot the red flags!

https://t.co/J0ggOh6FUW"
3,flag,"2/ The last weeks we have been mainly warning for scammers/scams (more than 80% of all newly created projects) in order to protect new, young, naive and easily influenced individuals and educate them to spot the red flags themselves."

1,project,"For those interested in a detailed background story about @SpacePoggersNFT and its founder @NiftyWhaleNFT, we refer to the extensive thread below. The project has completely new leadership now (under @RUG_TECH &amp; @natebear) and they confirmed the findings https://t.co/Cg2SZ9pDLq"
2,project,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."
3,project,"18/ When ChimpBet was launched, the publicly announced director of ChimpBet was directly identified as a Sales Director of RGT and people also noticed a resemblance with another RGT project called https://t.co/013tPQirQR. https://t.co/J57ZvsxYua"
4,project,"7/ Fun fact 1 – even Serena Williams’ coach of 10 years, Patrick Mouratoglou, is now an NFT/Crypto expert. He raised over a million with a project that he seems to have rugged, but he will come back in 2023 with a new coin. We can’t wait for this crypto guru to change the world. https://t.co/tMnt659PKx"
0,private,"@dlbrows You understand the difference between public and private information, yea?"
1,private,"3/ Some people have asked us, either publicly or privately, about our views on BAYC and especially regarding the potential “racism allegations”, to which the CEO of Yuga Labs has responded in the below interview (from 14:57 to 19:00): https://t.co/Zf9W0iBfRd"

3,private,"5/ In a private deal outside OS, he apparently scammed someone for 17ETH by not transferring his Doodle. There are many extensive threads (mainly in German) about all the fake giveaways as well, e.g. https://t.co/vAVKFdDTnd https://t.co/Pseqjlzz2B"
4,private,"It will be interesting to see how many people will complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) based on private information. When we did a bit of KYF (Know Your Founder) based on public information yesterday, not many people seem to have been too impressed. https://t.co/MJvJIqFnrP"
0,investment,"2/ It remains strange to us that many that are planning to spend 0.5 ETH on any project, don’t seem to do any research at all. If someone on the street asks you to give him/her $1300 USD as an investment into something, wouldn’t you do any proper due diligence?"
1,investment,"@arvinlolme @NFTherder Yes, in the thread he mentions that 3 months ago he made you aware of this and that nothing has been done yet. A bit more pro-activity wouldn't hurt don't you think? Certainly given the small investment it requires and the huge amount of primary/secondary sales in comparison."
2,investment,"2/ Via the OpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received “NFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investments”. We confirmed that these are genuine (seed) investors. https://t.co/phDWGuGilG"
3,investment,"@NFTherder @gmcapital_ One of the many reasons why we decided to release the information is that we had serious doubts about the existence of the investment fund. Apart from Beanie's background, the ISIN number did not match any database records and also consisted of 3 country code letters instead of 2 https://t.co/zmwVjhWWGf"

0,fund,"QG was focused on providing support such as funding for skills building &amp; education, inclusive housing &amp; medical aid, gender affirming care and more. 

Because queer POC need those wellbeing needs met before they can become diverse leaders in the first place."
1,fund,@realhumankinder Positive: probably ethical visibility for industries like clothing and their supply chains. A restructuring of power dynamics and wealth. Negative: maybe the decentralised nature allows easy funding for terrible things?
2,fund,"57/ When Beanie recently started re-using an old Twitter account for his new fund at GM Capital, he clearly did not seem to have been aware of that fact that this account was suggesting followers to follow the Twitter accounts of all his previous ""scams"". BLASTcx was another one. https://t.co/KGLN5lT50v"
3,fund,"12/ But it turns out it’s @Meta4Capital, and this is an interesting one. The reason is that this fund is backed by a16z (of course), but the $1.1 million pilot fund that preceded it was backed by a16z's Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon personally. https://t.co/55uLJ3LRxx https://t.co/4wBTPIBySD"
4,fund,"3/ It turns our Murtaza Akbar is from the UAE, but who is ""Nural Capital""? It's a fund just started by Rabia Iqbal (and backed by Kenetic) who used to work for Dubai's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, an investor in SoftBank's Vision Fund, which also invests in Animoca Brands. https://t.co/YtwFkvqYUK"
