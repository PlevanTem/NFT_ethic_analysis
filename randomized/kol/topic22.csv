0,22,yesterday,"1/ Not many people (pretended to have) understood our short thread from yesterday, but it confirmed how incestuous and hypocritical this space has become. So far we have seen 0 efforts and incentives for measures to keep people safe from nefarious actors. https://t.co/Ge1p6H6ZiV"
1,22,yesterday,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

2,22,yesterday,"1/ Another day, another rug pull. This time Lazy Lion Ape Club - 626 were minted for 0.08 ETH each yesterday, so that is 50 ETH profit. Website &amp; Twitter deleted, so that the large Twitter accounts that were involved in this scam don't have the evidence anymore on their timeline. https://t.co/WBNN9G8Zr8"

4,22,yesterday,"3/ They are not interested in the content on the NFT project (as exemplified yesterday where MontanaBlack promoted a project that included a Swastika), but only by money/whitelist spots. If they don't get what they want, they start to publicly call legitimate projects a ""scam"". https://t.co/oFDHpM16gv"

1,22,record,"@NFTherder @gmcapital_ One of the many reasons why we decided to release the information is that we had serious doubts about the existence of the investment fund.

2,22,record,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot.

0,22,track,"We knew his identity and ""track record"" (as far as you can speak of that when you are 19/20 years old) already for quite a while, but had hoped that he (and his father) would have made the right decision...

1,22,track,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let‚Äôs hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don‚Äôt have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else.

4,22,track,"Prepare for much more future amazement. We would be amazed if someone with a lot of influence in the NFT space did not in some way abuse that influence for personal gain and did not have a track record of 'manipulation'. So far we have not been amazed yet.

0,22,wallet,"21/ A couple of other obvious investors are: @moramoth (DortGod), @round21, @danielleleslie, @beijingdou, @banks &amp; @leetrink from @fazeclan, @NFTGOATS. Some investors we couldn‚Äôt identity or were not 100% sure about (e.g. the wallet below that only contains the Party Round NFT). https://t.co/3qVACKoYxF"
1,22,wallet,"4/ Justin Rose is part of the VC True Ventures, and together with GaryVee invested in Justin Aversano's Quantum Art. Also the FlamingoDAO of which both Justin and Gary are part invested in Quantum Art. So that explains why Aversano via his TwinFlames wallet paid 0.001 ETH (=$3) https://t.co/W59QJhgjt5"
2,22,wallet,"3/ Also the former Head of Marketing of TikTok, @atsignnick, knew about it, and his wallet was used to fund another wallet that bought Meebits. He seems to have been fired from TikTok earlier this year for ‚Äúgoing rogue‚Äù. https://t.co/4s8ngqAiY7"
3,22,wallet,"12/ They use a lot of different wallets to obfuscate all the transactions, but this transaction of 449 ETH was from one project alone. So how much did they rake in from all the other projects? https://t.co/mKc7DnWN9u"
4,22,wallet,"What is impossible IRL is possible in the NFT world. Two @CowgirlsNFT are dating 2 @pudgy_penguins (all founders) and they took advice from @ColeThereum how to drain wallets. No joke and we hope they fix this for the community. Full story from the head mod

0,22,transparency,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are ‚Äúdedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication‚Äù. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2"
1,22,transparency,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."
2,22,transparency,"@Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts It's just an innocent question. Web3 is all about transparency, so we are curious why the tweets are protected. Nothing more."
3,22,transparency,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
4,22,transparency,Ok so transparency is good. Providing platform to someone to use sexist and ableist slurs ain‚Äôt it. Tuning out.
0,22,transparent,"We need a non-profit advertising service that applies some level of due-diligence on the projects it promotes with standardised and transparent fees. 

All profits go to charity. 

I'd work on this for free if people are interested hmu."

2,22,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
3,22,transparent,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
4,22,transparent,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk

I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop.

We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
4,22,trust,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility ü§ùüíñ"
0,22,smart,"11/ Another one asks a question about why they don‚Äôt take a bit longer than 1.5 month to ask for $13 million USD and if we can see the smart contract in advance.

2,22,smart,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?
