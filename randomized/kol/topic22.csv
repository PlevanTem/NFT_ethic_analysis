0,company,"8/ And with regard to another founder, @ryancarson, there are quite some articles about how Treehouse (his former company) laid off close to 90% of its staff without severance pay, while he sold a mansion for over $3.2 million and bought a boat. Anyway, it's all about priorities. https://t.co/7fjK6xYShL"
1,company,"15/ Also with his current company he has shown that his moral compass is not pointing in the right direction, but if you have a net worth of over $13 billion, not many people are able to stand up against someone with so much money and influence. Some successfully did however. https://t.co/bMVmDsxA8b"

4,company,46/ A TokenPay entity in Switzerland was created (as usual behind a proxy) and stakes were bought into a real estate bank that didn‚Äôt make any profits. They also acquired 7% of a public company stock called Naked Brands (which has not been sold yet). https://t.co/ZLcPfM844W
0,value,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr
1,value,"1/ We have a couple of questions for @MoonPay/@isotowright, and its concierge service that a lot of celebrities already seem to have used to purchase some high value NFTs. We created a non-exhaustive list of these celebrities below. https://t.co/8Qi5k1fRln"
2,value,"1/ The Punks are the true OGs in this space and as such, have (had) a big influence on the direction of Web3 in general and on NFTs in particular. By acquiring the IP rights of LL, BAYC was able to change a competitor into an ally. Never underestimate the value of social capital."

1,bio,"13/ Her Instagram account has now been deleted, but in her IG bio, she only mentioned one word: cowabunga. We have to admit that we had never heard of that word, so had to look up ‚Äúreliable‚Äù sources to understand if this could mean anything. https://t.co/IBnQsFHXvh"

3,bio,"1/ If you are not aware of any crypto history and didn't follow the current Ripple lawsuit and the dubious role that Bill Hinman played as the director of the SEC's division of corporate finance, you won't understand the full picture.

0,purchase,It was a brilliant strategy from Yuga Labs. Let all the poor souls sell off their NFTs from other projects so that they could purchase (305) ApeCoin at the top and then create a ‚Äúhigh gas‚Äù minting process which only the ‚Äúrich &amp; influential‚Äù could afford. Win-win in true VC style.
