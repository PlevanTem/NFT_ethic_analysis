0,22,yesterday,"1/ Not many people (pretended to have) understood our short thread from yesterday, but it confirmed how incestuous and hypocritical this space has become. So far we have seen 0 efforts and incentives for measures to keep people safe from nefarious actors. https://t.co/Ge1p6H6ZiV"
1,22,yesterday,Just heard about the @Blockverse_NFT rug. The project sold out yesterday in less than 8 minutes (500 ETH) and had 792 ETH in secondary sales. Discord &amp; website closed and the anon devs are gone. Do we need a federated entity that approves all NFT projects and its doxxed founders?
2,22,yesterday,"2/3 He actually pointed out the same issue with LarvaLabs earlier than we did yesterday, and even seems to indicate that that was the reason that LarvaLabs didn‚Äôt dump all their 1000 V1 Punks because they got caught out by him. https://t.co/FllJ19V1Y3"

4,22,yesterday,"Some people asked us what we think of LuckyLionClub. It's the same spam/scam as all the other 3D NFT projects that we discussed yesterday &amp; the day before. All promoted by ""paid NFT influencers"", that are only interested in 1 thing: $$$. Same applies to BoredGoats and many others https://t.co/0w6K5WaZdP"
0,22,record,"An impressive track record: of a16z‚Äôs 17 portfolio companies that went public at initial valuations of $1 billion or more in roughly the past 18 months, all but 1 are trading below their offer price.

1,22,record,"If you had looked at the company records for Ryan Carson's former company Treehouse, you would see an interesting name as director: Chamath Palihapitiya, king of SPACs. A billionaire who made more than $290 million based on a $25k investment.

2,22,record,"Prepare for much more future amazement. We would be amazed if someone with a lot of influence in the NFT space did not in some way abuse that influence for personal gain and did not have a track record of 'manipulation'. So far we have not been amazed yet.

4,22,record,"Another big thread about @0xHustler and the project @SavePlanetEarth that is minting later today. It shows once again the dubious ""track records"" that certain people have and how they try to benefit from naive individuals that blindly trust ""charities"".

https://t.co/vZYRumffLc"
0,22,track,8/ Someone did an analysis and tracked exactly where the funds went. Thanks @magicienmaartre. But it gets worse ‚Äì far worse. Why do you think @NFT promoted certain projects so much? https://t.co/Fn88TYLdl3
1,22,track,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.

0,22,wallet,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
1,22,wallet,"We recently mentioned that ""scammers have entered the NFT space at an industrial scale"". Some exceptional and altruistic individuals in this space have provided us with evidence of wallet connections linking many of these scam projects. This is very big and will soon be revealed."
2,22,wallet,"LOVE IS IN THE AIRü•∞ To celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day, #TrustVibes is giving away a 'Limited Edition' TrustValentine #NFT to every $TRUST holder. üéâ ‚úÖMake sure you are holding at least 100+ $TRUST tokens in your wallet to be eligible. üî•üì∏Snapshot: 14th February 11:59pm UTC https://t.co/LigTHQ3ofo"
3,22,wallet,3/ And we found indeed the exact same wallet connections with even more projects. It confirms the suspicion that there are various scam rings that churn out project and project as we already mentioned before. https://t.co/AZfsgI3cMR
4,22,wallet,"5/ We also see Serena Williams via an unnamed wallet (she also received a CloneX for free from RTFKT), who is of course the wife of Alexis Ohanian, investor in Yuga Labs via his VC @SevenSevenSix and is also an investor in Party Round with a16z. But the ties with a16z go deeper. https://t.co/B1IICWIuPh"
0,22,transparency,"In the interest of transparency, I know this family personally üíñ"
1,22,transparency,Join our co-founder @thisispaff for an important discussion on pay transparency in web3! A must listen for any budding project leads &amp; contributors.
2,22,transparency,This is a very unique and important project I feel. A touching and poignant insight into how cancer affects so many. *full disclosure/transparency this is something that has been created by one of my close friend‚Äôs elderly father
3,22,transparency,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
4,22,transparency,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
0,22,transparent,"@brddtrvllr @Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
1,22,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
2,22,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
3,22,transparent,"Artists being able to verify the origins of their work in a transparent way, and buyers being able to see that verification - Yey"
4,22,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."

1,22,trust,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
2,22,trust,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust. This is a tactic that Beanie is well aware of and frequently uses."
3,22,trust,"With the #TrustVibes #NFTMarketplace just around the cornerü§Ø @JustinWBratton interviewsüéôÔ∏è @hafiizkarim, a talented young Singaporean #NFTartist making waves in the #NFT Community.

4,22,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
0,22,smart,"5/ Some other insiders were ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù and decided to create new wallets to purchase lots of Meebits in advance of the announcement, including:
0x2efe6e9b127679f158718c1ea296f0ad9120c50a

1,22,smart,"11/ Another one asks a question about why they don‚Äôt take a bit longer than 1.5 month to ask for $13 million USD and if we can see the smart contract in advance. The founder again comes up with a long-winded story. They talk a lot, but never seem to realize their inconsistencies. https://t.co/pUytDpfgmB"
2,22,smart,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.

https://t.co/HjnfLA5kY0 https://t.co/4dPqEIIWop"
3,22,smart,"3/ He also mentions that he is a hustler (which we consider to be a true statement in line with his Twitter handle) that doesn't use his ""smart to scam people"". But whether that is true depends on your definition of scamming. https://t.co/iAwL9cJeke"
4,22,smart,"16/ After that moment, the TRUSTH scores will start to become dependent on your trading behavior, and how much it can go up/down will depend on a smart algorithm that takes into account your buying/selling pattern and volume."

1,22,contract,"We simply have to all agree that we don‚Äôt mint any project with mint prices &gt;0.1 (ideally lower). It will disincentive scammers to go for cash grabs, will keep more liquidity in the NFT/ETH ecosystem and will create more innovation in this space (e.g. performance-based contracts)"
