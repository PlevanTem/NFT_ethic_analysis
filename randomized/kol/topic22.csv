1,22,aint,"FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out https://t.co/R5eRU4VBXV"

0,22,admire,@ReeseW Welcome to NFTs Reece! I‚Äôm the founder of an NFT project @Deadfellaznft - other women and gender diverse folks in the space that I admire are @iamlirona @stephyfung @dielamaharanie @GlamBeckettArt @grelysian @NftFat @nftnofriends @cryptostacys and many more

0,22,announced,"22/ It makes it even more shameless to see that in Scalar Capital‚Äôs pitch deck, they explicitly mention that they bought 0x at $0.048. Fun fact: Coinbase just announced 0x Labs as their NFT partner and the price of ZRX skyrocketed. https://t.co/l5KMkEr67F"
1,22,announced,"18/ When ChimpBet was launched, the publicly announced director of ChimpBet was directly identified as a Sales Director of RGT and people also noticed a resemblance with another RGT project called https://t.co/013tPQirQR. https://t.co/J57ZvsxYua"
2,22,announced,"6/ The Bored Ape that Gwyneth Paltrow announced to have received via MoonPay on 26 Jan 2022 was already purchased by MoonPay more two months earlier (15 Nov 2021). Does that imply that MoonPay is actively investing in NFTs, even before a potential celebrity wants to purchase one? https://t.co/PzV9G84pIZ"
3,22,announced,"10/ If someone asks about why they initially announced an astronaut to be part of the project, one of the founders said he screwed up and asks an ambassador to better answer the question. The ambassador then basically says: wait till after mint and then we go to the moon. https://t.co/G5CucS65CT"
4,22,announced,"1/ Before our upcoming threads about VCs &amp; Web3, we first thought to share with you the investors in @yugalabs that have not been publicly announced. They were part of the ‚ÄúParty Round‚Äù and include some well-known influencers. It might show you ‚Äú(an)otherside‚Äù (pun intended)."
0,22,cause,"Quite a few people have messaged us about our opinion of @fRiENDSiES_Ai and their Dutch Auction later today that could bring in over $100 million USD. They are afraid to speak out because this project is ""shilled"" by many big influencers. We will do a thread on this later today. https://t.co/goxQ1vnpsV"
1,22,cause,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"
2,22,cause,"20/ And he mentions that people especially trusted @NFT because of Mark Cuban‚Äôs name on the page and the blue verified account. They tried to remove his name after this scandal came out, but the screenshots were already taken. https://t.co/r1aX2fNcf9"
3,22,cause,"@DataNFT_ Correct! And special thanks for the last words. I aim to bring vis/invisible disability into the equity and diversity agenda. It's a triple work. We have to overcome the stigma of a charitable cause, understand that it's not only about representation but accessibility &amp; inclusion"

0,22,comparison,"@arvinlolme @NFTherder Yes, in the thread he mentions that 3 months ago he made you aware of this and that nothing has been done yet. A bit more pro-activity wouldn't hurt don't you think? Certainly given the small investment it requires and the huge amount of primary/secondary sales in comparison."
1,22,comparison,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, ‚Äútrust the process‚Äù implies the team knows what they‚Äôre doing."
0,22,avoiding,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn‚Äôt equate to inorganic growth imo - it‚Äôs a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won‚Äôt work the next but as long as you‚Äôre authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you‚Äôre good
