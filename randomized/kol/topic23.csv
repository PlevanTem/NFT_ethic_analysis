1,23,time,"Three months ago @nesotual was a co-founder of @gemxyz (see video at 6:28: https://t.co/UVZ8pu4d4F), but after the sexual misconduct allegations, @LorensHuculak mentioned he was a anon developer &amp; team member.

3,23,time,@kmoney_69 Trust your gut. It‚Äôs hard to differentiate anxiety from intuition at times but you got this.
4,23,time,There was a time when everyone in the Web3/crypto/NFT space was supporting each other with a common goal to make this tech more mainstream. But now our paths are diverging and we are all playing musical chairs. It's a beautiful interplay between human cooperation and competition.
0,23,stop,"Just a general warning for everyone. It has become clear that scammers have entered the NFT space at an industrial scale.

4,23,mind,"54/ The domain name for Huntingdon Investment was only registered just before the ICO launch, so it only seems to be used to provide credibility to the claim that Beanie was only an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù instead of the mastermind behind it.

0,23,bro,"An important read, especially to understand how entangled VCs are with money from anti-Web3 countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Two days ago Jared Kushner received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia for his new VC. His brother is an investor in @yugalabs.

1,23,bro,"16/ Next on the list are Dr. Paul Judge, who also explicitly mentions that his projects have been backed by a16z and @0xAllen_, who is working for VaynerNFT, which is of course owned by GaryVee and his brother AJ, both investors in Yuga Labs. https://t.co/GG9LM5Ne6Y"
2,23,bro,The business model of VCs is that the best investment in a successful fund/venture equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund/ventures combined. It‚Äôs the same with NFTs and this Web3 model is now brought into the lives of ordinary people. The implications are far-reaching.

It explains the heated discussion between OSF and @Pranksy, and also why Farokh hosted the meeting with the Yuga board members. https://t.co/rkpLh3UIhN"
1,23,like,"13/ If you are consistently showing opportunistic, selfish and unethical behavior (large amounts of wash trading, lots of TornadoCash‚Äôing, lots of WL/minting abuse, lots of undisclosed paid ads revenue streams, etc, etc), your TRUSTH score will likely be low."
2,23,like,"2/ Contrary to popular belief, we have no problem with capitalism and we don‚Äôt like hypocritical governments and their civil servants who milk the tax system to pay their salaries and justify their own existence."
3,23,like,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
4,23,like,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We are not saying that, but we do hope that more experts like you do a deep dive into all those similarly looking and advertised projects that minted in the past week and are about to mint that are all connected. Could potentially be the biggest ""heist"" in NFT history."
0,23,buy,"20/ Many influencers &amp; artists don‚Äôt care about where the money is coming from or is going (hint: LooksRare). As long as they make money and people buy their art for enormous amounts, they are happy to say how great and beneficial NFTs are. Changing the narrative sometimes helps. https://t.co/GaDdk4UlFs"
1,23,buy,"Artists being able to verify the origins of their work in a transparent way, and buyers being able to see that verification - Yey"
2,23,buy,9/ We have provided some background info on 888. He has also not been active on Twitter anymore. Maybe he travelled to Thailand to buy himself a(nother) wife or maybe he is busy asking Harvey Weinstein for legal advice. https://t.co/4mDbTTpB4v
3,23,buy,"16/ After that moment, the TRUSTH scores will start to become dependent on your trading behavior, and how much it can go up/down will depend on a smart algorithm that takes into account your buying/selling pattern and volume."
4,23,buy,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."

2,23,trust,"7. If you have problems setting it up or it's not working DO NOT post your problem in a public domain, because 99% of the time it'll get answered by a scammer who'll try to exploit you. Best thing to do is DM someone you trust for support."
