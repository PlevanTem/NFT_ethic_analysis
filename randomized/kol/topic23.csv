It's really nice to see a lot of people get called and found out finally."
3,think,"11/ And talking about ""diversity"": did you know that @friendswithyou both seems to think that BAYC is racist, but also has been accused of racism themselves? Well, the below attachments show just that. Life is ironic sometimes. https://t.co/CAVDiPPQcV"

1,trust,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

2,trust,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as ‚Äúlearning experiences‚Äù) and trust the process (don‚Äôt ask any questions, but ‚Äútrust us‚Äù). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN"
3,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
