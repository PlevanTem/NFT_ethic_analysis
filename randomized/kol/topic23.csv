0,23,bird,"@NFTethics @moonbirds_xyz I’m gutted because when you first came into the scene you wrote good shit and it was a real prevention mechanism for future scammers. 

Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It’s a shame really."
1,23,bird,"1/ Some people contacted us to ask our opinion on @moonbirds_xyz that is minting tomorrow for 2.5 ETH, which would take out more than 75 million USD out of the ecosystem. As usual, many are afraid to speak out because they don't want to offend ""powerful"" Web3/NFT influencers/VCs. https://t.co/YXvAqs8mwn"

When TUS was born 4 weeks ago, we made a conscious decision to build in public and be transparent.

2,23,born,@phuktep @JaymesWestfall @DeezeFi @dsphoto1985 This is bullshit. Deeze is one of the good guys and genuinely just loves the banter of collecting NFTs. I'd trust him with my unborn children.

It's a fund just started by Rabia Iqbal (and backed by Kenetic) who used to work for Dubai's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, an investor in SoftBank's Vision Fund, which also invests in Animoca Brands. https://t.co/YtwFkvqYUK"
2,23,bad,"@NFTherder @youbekindtoday FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out."
3,23,bad,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility 🤝💖"
4,23,bad,"More than 3 months ago, the ratio of well intentioned projects and bad intentioned ones was probably around 80%-20%. 

That ratio has in our view shifted: 80% are now likely scams and 20% are projects that really want to build something.

This makes sense:
