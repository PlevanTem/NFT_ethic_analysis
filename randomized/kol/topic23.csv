0,23,bro,"An important read, especially to understand how entangled VCs are with money from anti-Web3 countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Two days ago Jared Kushner received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia for his new VC. His brother is an investor in @yugalabs.

https://t.co/dKaMeaV4qh https://t.co/5eBnV3ewVw"
1,23,bro,"@dlbrows You understand the difference between public and private information, yea?"
2,23,bro,The business model of VCs is that the best investment in a successful fund/venture equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund/ventures combined. It‚Äôs the same with NFTs and this Web3 model is now brought into the lives of ordinary people. The implications are far-reaching.

4,23,bro,"16/ Next on the list are Dr. Paul Judge, who also explicitly mentions that his projects have been backed by a16z and @0xAllen_, who is working for VaynerNFT, which is of course owned by GaryVee and his brother AJ, both investors in Yuga Labs. https://t.co/GG9LM5Ne6Y"
0,23,like,"It looks like the SEC's experience with @ElonMusk, the owner of the first NFT Company or Company NFT that was shilled on Twitter, will likely serve as a blueprint for the future regulation of NFTs. More background here: https://t.co/KU17A6PENE"
1,23,like,"27/ It is ironic that Beanie often mentions his dislike for low-effort copy pastas, when we have to conclude that Monkey Bet DAO and Baboon Bet (1000 ETH mint in total) was nothing more than just that: a copy pasta of RGT‚Äôs earlier products. https://t.co/YHhDc8nukM"
2,23,like,"24/ We mentioned earlier that self-regulation is key to move this space further (mainstream). To add an incentive: those that will be able to come up with ethical solutions, will likely be the ones that will financially benefit from this space the most. https://t.co/t61tJy9a63"
3,23,like,"2/ The CEO of MoonPay, @isotowright, gave an interview with @theblock__, but some of the questions were not (properly) answered, so we would like to ask these questions again. The article can be found here (and we will refer to it in the tweets below): https://t.co/NIsofaeOtN"
4,23,like,"For all the naive NFT newbies, we would like to refer to the below statement:

0,23,buy,"The Web3/NFT space can be regarded as a microcosm of the VC world based on the right connections, buying low &amp; selling high, over-hyping and lots of phony philanthropy &amp; fake positivity. We will soon shine a light on all the VCs/individuals involved in pushing this space forward."
1,23,buy,"Imagine a scenario of huge consolidation where 1 successful/rich NFT project buys up lots of other promising and undervalued NFT projects and then, after a year, decides to sell it all to Meta/Facebook, Microsoft or any VC. From Web 3.0 to REKT 4.0. Welcome to The Metaverse 19.84"
2,23,buy,"2/ They would either reach out to celebrities or celebrities would contact them, so if you have been rugged, know that @jf_nft/@0xAA_NFT were responsible. They allegedly told insiders not to buy what they posted at @NFT IG because they knew they were rugs.
https://t.co/0wtvrvj7E2"
3,23,buy,"Elon Musk wanting to buy Twitter fits into the more common trend of billionaires wanting to buy clout via media companies: Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, Changpeng Zhao (Binance) ""invested"" $200 million in Forbes. Not the ""truth"" matters, but how many you can ""influence""."
4,23,buy,"24/ Also remember that if you ever see a tweet from @jf_nft in which he asks which NFT to buy, he is likely buying it with your money that he gained via all kinds of dodgy scams. This whole space is filled with charlatans, and many are high profile names that operate in networks."
