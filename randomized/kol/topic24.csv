0,24,breaking,"Normally scam projects gain in 2 major ways. First via all the mint money (and royalties), but secondly because the scammers sell off all their free/cheap NFTs they got from the WL sale off on OS during the initial hype for a lot of money. We are breaking that business model."
0,24,block,"3/ They are often influencers with large followings: Farokh, Deeze, Ohhshiny (who blocked us - more about that next week when we discuss all the billionaires active in the NFT space), and they did lots of interviews with all of them. https://t.co/XcXCA7Wwcb"
1,24,block,"2/ The CEO of MoonPay, @isotowright, gave an interview with @theblock__, but some of the questions were not (properly) answered, so we would like to ask these questions again. The article can be found here (and we will refer to it in the tweets below): https://t.co/NIsofaeOtN"
2,24,block,"5/ The project has blocked and booted every person that knows what‚Äôs going on from their Discord, including @tylengyel, the most active member who owns the trademark to Bored Bunny. The project didn't respond to his C&amp;D letter. https://t.co/eDmAaevesi"
3,24,block,"Dear @nftchance - we hear that you are creating novel concepts with interesting implications, but for some reason you seem to have blocked us and we can't read your messages. Any specific reason why you blocked us and any chance you can unblock us?

1,24,announce,"6/ The Bored Ape that Gwyneth Paltrow announced to have received via MoonPay on 26 Jan 2022 was already purchased by MoonPay more two months earlier (15 Nov 2021). Does that imply that MoonPay is actively investing in NFTs, even before a potential celebrity wants to purchase one? https://t.co/PzV9G84pIZ"
2,24,announce,"1/ Before our upcoming threads about VCs &amp; Web3, we first thought to share with you the investors in @yugalabs that have not been publicly announced. They were part of the ‚ÄúParty Round‚Äù and include some well-known influencers. It might show you ‚Äú(an)otherside‚Äù (pun intended)."
3,24,announce,"10/ If someone asks about why they initially announced an astronaut to be part of the project, one of the founders said he screwed up and asks an ambassador to better answer the question. The ambassador then basically says: wait till after mint and then we go to the moon. https://t.co/G5CucS65CT"
