2,24,world,"7/ In a centralized world, the normal governance structure is top-down, but in a decentralized world it’s bottom-up. It should ideally (first) come from the individuals (us) and the NFT projects themselves: self-regulation."

0,24,space,1/ A quick thread about the importance and current lack of ethics in the NFT space. We have noticed that a lot of the same persons are involved in multiple rugs. It’s probably even fair to say that there is a very small cartel of influential players that are serial ruggers.
1,24,space,"@hunconscious Not necessarily earn my place, but I see women not being taken as seriously. Talked over or not given time in Twitter spaces, a lot of mansplaining dms, misgendering etc. I think people overlook the hurdles and barriers in place for many women and gender diverse folks here"
2,24,space,"@artskooltourist @Friendswithyou The tweet served the purpose to show that they were ""reasonably early"" active in the NFT space and connected with many currently quite prominent NFT ""influencers""."
3,24,space,I don’t have any spicy takes on today’s news but I will defend the notion of anonymity in Web3. There are so many working anon here for many reasons including personal safety &amp; the ability to navigate the space without the bias that may follow their intersecting identities.

0,24,project,"The project @DeluxeGoat is 99.9% a scam (also minting today). Founders have 0 and 1 post on IG. They paid for Google ads, and one of the founders could well be the same one as the one from ""Immortal Apes"" as he writes gas both times in an unusual (and incorrect) way. Gass what? https://t.co/RamDHzBDxe"
1,24,project,"19/ There is a CryptoBet video on YouTube that features a person that has exactly the same voice as the MBD project lead Owlman (Twitter handle: Owlman1of1), and during one of the MB Twitter Spaces Beanie mentioned his first name, which did indeed match. https://t.co/fAgBJELle4"
2,24,project,"15/ Just so that people know, @NFT asked $20000-$25000 per IG post and the minimum amount was 5 posts, to they would rake in anyway $100k- $125k per project! They also suggested that more posts is relatively cheaper, so ideal for scammers with multiple projects. https://t.co/pe18LOJWDy"
3,24,project,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F
