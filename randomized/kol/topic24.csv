0,24,space,17/ They will soon become so (financially) powerful and influential that they determine the (ethical) direction of this space. They will become too big to fail in this space.
1,24,space,"21/ If anyone tries to make any critical comment about it, they are completely ridiculed. But others can freely say that no one cares about art and it’s all about the money. Being hypocritical has become an art in itself in this space. https://t.co/CHikSJRnyR"
2,24,space,"6/ In some way it’s not fair to call out these individuals, because there are literally hundreds of similar people active in this space, all with connections to morally bankrupt agencies, sporters, celebrities, social media executives, etc. We have called them out in the past."
3,24,space,"24/ Linda Xie is very well connected in the NFT space, is a personal investor in OpenSea, a ""close friend of a16z” (in a16z’s own words). Zagabond quit his job at 0x Labs in September and was congratulated on Twitter by Linda Xie and Will Warren. https://t.co/SfDOtnvQ0P"
4,24,space,"@flynnkristina @Science_stanley @rollnwthehomies @some_place @LanaHopkins3 @jdisimone_ Considering accessibilty needs whatever we're developing in the space. It's really important to normalise disability inclusion &amp; talking about it in the context of equity &amp; diversity. We're talking 1.2B ppl. I often face the problem of ""charitable"" as soon as I mention disability"
0,24,collection,"2/ Some mentioned that we should check the purchases of proof collective, as many wallets only contains the proof collection and the floor is now 88 ETH. Wash trading is so common in so many projects these days that it's not even noteworthy anymore. https://t.co/zgVpXsxzNC"

3,24,collection,@pixelbot24 Fair point. :) These are actual real names of NFT collections. And we do have all the names of the people behind these rugs.
4,24,collection,"With @MuriNFT being a legitimate collection by @haustwts, it shows that once a project does well and reputable, it immediately creates many copycats that try to benefit from a particular brand or its success. We have seen this with (Bored) Apes, Wolf Game, etc, etc."
0,24,community,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
1,24,community,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions “community first”, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all."
2,24,community,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions “community first”, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all."
3,24,community,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as “learning experiences”) and trust the process (don’t ask any questions, but “trust us”). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN"
4,24,community,"13/ This is a project with artists that have the right connections, but have not necessarily shown to have a track record in the NFT space, and the roadmap is also very vague, or even non existent. It will all be soon revealed and also will depend on what the community wants. https://t.co/DY47Kt7rJX"
0,24,project,"We never endorse projects, but both @GoGalaGames and @BT are very reputable and their involvement in the NFT/Web3 space is beneficial to all.

We hope that any new players will choose the influencers that they want to work with very wisely in the future.

https://t.co/nmYo9yxYeO"
1,24,project,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico’s Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"
2,24,project,"@OttoSuwenNFT It was indeed a conservative estimation. It could well be even above 95%. These scammers are basically factories that churn out project after project - just mindless JPEGs, without any vision/roadmap. Only fake/corrupt influencers behind them who are willing to promote this stuff"
3,24,project,"Many people that are socially or financially invested in a project or person, seem to turn a blind eye to any ethical issues regarding that project or person. They measure morality in dollars or degree of loyalty/friendship. In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
4,24,project,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.
