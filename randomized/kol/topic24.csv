1,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
2,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good

0,group,22/ The irony or sad reality is that an increasingly smaller group has/had to pay increasingly higher taxes in order to compensate for those people and corporations that are able to use all kinds of (il)legal loopholes to minimize their societal contributions.

3,group,"@Chodan_Bakri Respectfully, I disagree. A huge amount of incredible work doesn’t do well because of implicit bias and the unequal representation of genders within the space. Until we reach that equality, more effort needs to be put into amplifying underrepresented groups."
4,group,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"
