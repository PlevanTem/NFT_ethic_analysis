1,research,14/ Many people now start to notice that our statement below was not an exaggeration. It served as a real warning to really do your research and see the characteristics that all these scam projects have in common (in the same way you distinguish spam emails from legit ones). https://t.co/gyYHnKYMEH

3,website,"3/ Doctor Troller (AKA Andrew Brown) was the founder of a project called @CrocsLeague, which was a complete rug pull. The website from Crocs does not show the team anymore, but the Way Back Machine still shows the team. It also shows Asha Serano, his partner (in crime). https://t.co/jxja8Nc0p6"
4,website,"31/ There was a Facebook group and website by unsatisfied customers of RGT. When Beanie understood that his identity was linked to RGT and that his name was mentioned on these websites, they paid these people off to take the websites down.

2,sol,"9/ The digit(al)ization of the world has made physical/country borders less absolute and more fluid (and even non-existent to some extent). You only have to look at the market capitalization of the Big 5: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft."
3,sol,"Imagine a scenario of huge consolidation where 1 successful/rich NFT project buys up lots of other promising and undervalued NFT projects and then, after a year, decides to sell it all to Meta/Facebook, Microsoft or any VC. From Web 3.0 to REKT 4.0. Welcome to The Metaverse 19.84"

0,member,16/ We also have confirmation from multiple sources that the @NFT team and the Squiggles team (a team involved in many rugs) exchanged “staff members” (via Luxury Equities by Ali S. and Gavin M.) so it’s all far less innocent and much more connected/orchestrated than it looks.

0,project,"@SerpentAU Our comment was to highlight a general issue that many might not be aware of. This is less/not of an issue for legitimate projects, but if you own art from a ""scam project"" that doesn't care about the project long-term, it is possible that you can technically ""lose"" your NFT."

1,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
2,trust,"❓❓❓ How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.
