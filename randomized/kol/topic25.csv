0,25,team,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
1,25,team,"17/ The so called “big lie” is a tactic that Beanie frequently uses: ""a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"". Anyone who doubted his words, was actively banned by him and his team. https://t.co/54BPxX9EB6"
2,25,team,"We said it before, but for people new(ish) to the space, there is simply no justification to ask millions upfront by undoxxed, unproven teams with nothing than some fancy JPEGs and fake influencers promoting it.

Mint price for many past projects was &lt;0.1

https://t.co/qVE9dmGOSk"
3,25,team,"If you are new to the NFT space, our advice would be not to mint ANY project for the coming 2 weeks. We have indications that the same scam team created many projects each day, and they only have a limited time window before they are found out. That's why they delay the ""reveal""."
4,25,team,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."

0,25,transparency,"We wish we had this a month ago!

To onboard more underrepresented groups into #web3, we need transparency and free flow of knowledge &amp; insights, especially with the beast that is launching an #NFTProject!

Highly recommend all new (or wannabe) NFT Creators check this one out. 🙌🏽"

2,25,transparency,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
3,25,transparency,"In the interest of transparency, I know this family personally 💖"
4,25,transparency,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."

0,25,member,8/ Why would anyone want to be(come) part of a project where a significant number of members are scamming others? And why would Yuga Labs or Larva Labs want their reputation to be put at risk by a (still) very small minority?
1,25,member,"3/ Some names are very obvious: @farokh and his @rugradio friends @osf_nft, @greatmando_nft (via the canaryvault wallet) and @belikewater893. It explains the heated discussion between OSF and @Pranksy, and also why Farokh hosted the meeting with the Yuga board members. https://t.co/rkpLh3UIhN"
2,25,member,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
3,25,member,"25/ To quote Jason again: ""we're all in this TOGETHER. And remember WAGMI."" Especially the billionaires that have already made it and who are going to make much and much more. We will write more about all these billionaires soon. https://t.co/32LGOTXpcY"
4,25,member,"We were contacted by a member of the community who said they claimed the original account for us, and has since handed over the handle. 
We didn’t trust this right away due to the murkiness of the entire situation."
0,25,project,"11/ Some asked us – why Beanie? We just happened to significantly invest in his project(s). We did not sell any NFT before exposing him, and our wallet transaction(s) confirm that. We are willing to have this verified. We have no affiliation with anyone or any financial incentive"
1,25,project,"We want to emphasize one more time the importance of the below thread about red flags.

A project called @ApeDoods is minting today (total scam with fake/corrupt influencers) and many others are minting soon. Identify the obvious scams and cash grabs.

https://t.co/J0ggOh6FUW https://t.co/AHl6QyXrQN"
2,25,project,"1/ We have a couple of quick observations about the project @theshifters_ (90k Discord members), which will soon start minting. We were informed by multiple persons that tried to ask some questions that they were banned/blocked, so maybe it helps if we clarify their position."
3,25,project,"The NFT space basically consists of two worlds: 

1. Experienced investors that use Twitter/reputable contacts for their info. 
2. Inexperienced naifs that get their info from paid shills at Instagram.

They never talk about or even mention the same projects."
4,25,project,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"

1,25,trust,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"

1,25,community,"What happens to BAYC if all 10k Bored Apes have been bought by (bored) celebrities? They all try to become part of an exciting new community, but will gradually realize that it’s the same community that they are already part of. Good thing you can't photoshop the blockchain."
2,25,community,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.
3,25,community,"@AngelLabsIO @meta_angels Our vision is a world with more diverse leaders! We’re using NFTs to accelerate this via crowdfunding to provide:

4,25,community,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
