We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.

3,25,team,"1/ Multiple sources confirmed to us that Mark Cuban's @NFT IG team actually created NFTs for the celebrities that they worked with. They would share the profit 50/50 and the celebrities didn't have to do anything. @NFT hired the artists, ran the Discords and did everything else. https://t.co/qfxoeK8t4f"

1,25,transparency,"❓❓❓ What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
✔ NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
2,25,transparency,"23/ Scalar Capital is also an investor in Dfinity, which is the former employer of Whizwang (Elizabeth Yang), and Twitter shows that the 2 know each other.

0,25,member,23/ One potentially other interesting aspect is that many of the Yuga Labs execs originate from a company called “Something New”. We identified at least 5 members and it could well be that this company has a financial stake in the success of Yuga. https://t.co/nxUrxkTAyt
1,25,member,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
2,25,member,"2/ All the team members from MetaMansionsNFT are coming from Canada, but on the KeyLead website Dubai, UAE is clearly mentioned as the key location next to Vancouver, Canada (right-bottom corner). https://t.co/NKMg34spGO"
3,25,member,"6/ Serena is very good friends with Chris Lyons, the partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) who is now also at the board of Yuga Labs. Serena herself has just raised $111 million for her own VC, and at least one of her staff members was introduced via a16z. https://t.co/4KGI7ivMt9"

1,25,project,"2/ Some mentioned that we should check the purchases of proof collective, as many wallets only contains the proof collection and the floor is now 88 ETH. Wash trading is so common in so many projects these days that it's not even noteworthy anymore. https://t.co/zgVpXsxzNC"
2,25,project,19/ Scalar Capital claimed that it provides “asymmetric info” and “early access to projects” to its partners. We know that because a confidential pitch deck of Scalar Capital was leaked. It has some interesting slides. https://t.co/6GGMpwRPO9
3,25,project,Of course @hypebearsclub never responded. They count on people that are only active on Instagram and ban anyone who calls them out. Minting day is the finish line for these projects and it's sad that naive people will pay a big price entering the NFT space https://t.co/JvhxUb7JsR https://t.co/Hmzqg7BrnZ
4,25,project,3/ And we found indeed the exact same wallet connections with even more projects. It confirms the suspicion that there are various scam rings that churn out project and project as we already mentioned before. https://t.co/AZfsgI3cMR
0,25,trust,"2/2 When confronted with that, he said that his account was hacked by someone else and that he didn't have anything to do with it. In December the kind soul @Zeneca_33 already wrote a thread about him. Shame that a small minority makes us all less trustful https://t.co/EYdquGmTg4"
1,25,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
2,25,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
3,25,trust,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"
