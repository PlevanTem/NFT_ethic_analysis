0,26,cognitive,"1. OG crypto and NFT people are paranoid about future ""winters"". This is a cognitive bias; the ""curse of knowledge"". What's different now compared to 2018 is mass adoption, proven concepts, technology and utility. We're not getting another crypto winter."
1,26,cognitive,"3. I keep saying this but curse of knowledge cognitive bias is definitely steering me to be cautious; whereas this time last year being a newbie I was going gung-ho, as I would be if I was a newbie rn. 

So let's see, hopefully my caution is not needed."
0,26,apart,"8/ The two devs of BAYC, Kerem Atalay and Zeshan Ali, both graduated from the University of Maryland (Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences), but apart from that, we have not been able to find much more about them. https://t.co/3UxSyU0Frn"
1,26,apart,"10/ We did indeed find that also Gregory Solano also graduated from the University of Maryland, and didn’t find anything about Wylie Aranow, apart from the fact that his father was very (in)famous and some of the info he revealed in interviews (""his gambling-problem days""). https://t.co/LyF9VFtQCQ"
0,26,case,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name. It is obvious in whose possession those valuable domain names are or were in case they have been resold. The domains were listed on https://t.co/bpvWhH592q. https://t.co/dUgpCIuQqk"
1,26,case,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let’s hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don’t have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else. You might want to review some of your past digital tracks to make that not too easy...
2,26,case,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.

3,26,case,"43/ One of the largest and most prominent crypto scams he has been involved in is the case of TokenPay (TPAY), whereby he pretended again to be an investor, but really was suspected to be acting as the CEO behind the screens. He wrote the WP foreword, see: https://t.co/Oe2utTitIz"
4,26,case,4/ We noticed that some Bored and Mutant Apes have been transferred (for free) to MoonPay’s OS account from different other accounts including (for example) @nft42_/@j1mmyeth’s OS account. Can you clarify why that is the case and how these people have been compensated? https://t.co/AwVJmutf9t
0,26,career,"7/ We are aware of the sensitivity of doxing someone in the Web3 space, and we recently gave someone a subtle warning. It avoids that you potentially harm someone’s career and project (including their holders), and it serves as an incentive for the person to behave ethically."
1,26,career,Not many people dare to bite the hand(s) that feed them. Not many people dare to stand up against powerful/influential people who have the ability to (digitally) destroy their (NFT) careers/lives. For many it’s just easier to look the other way and remain silent. Too much to lose
2,26,career,"32/ So was this an isolated incident that Beanie was involved in? When diving into his past, this was only the tip of the iceberg and there is a pattern during his very dubious “professional career”. We briefly provide a chronological overview."
