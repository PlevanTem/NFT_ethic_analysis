We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
3,great,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.
4,great,"❓❓❓ What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
✔ NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"

3,news,I don’t have any spicy takes on today’s news but I will defend the notion of anonymity in Web3. There are so many working anon here for many reasons including personal safety &amp; the ability to navigate the space without the bias that may follow their intersecting identities.
4,news,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately “survive”, so the current state of the market is that “bad news” for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."

1,trust,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
2,trust,"7. If you have problems setting it up or it's not working DO NOT post your problem in a public domain, because 99% of the time it'll get answered by a scammer who'll try to exploit you. Best thing to do is DM someone you trust for support."
3,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
