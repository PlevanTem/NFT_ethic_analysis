2,26,trust,"RIP Metabots. This isn't the first rug pull and won't be the last. Find a dev team you trust, and make sure the art isn't stolen! We could do with an overall ""background"" check of artwork of all recent collectibles tbh."
3,26,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
4,26,trust,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"

4,26,story,"1/ A quick update on MontanaBlack who in actual fact seems to have &gt;20 million followers on all kinds of platforms. The story shows how many of these scam rings operate. There is always someone in the background doing the ""dirty"" work functioning as the intermediary and fall guy. https://t.co/SVtpeby664"
0,26,project,"9/ We have received confirmation from multiple independent sources that Marc Cuban's @NFT venture offered equity to projects that had the potential to sell out. That would also explain why they received so much money from certain projects and why they did so much ""due diligence"". https://t.co/zlFX9mwfXM"
1,26,project,"We wrote about these projects a while back and @zachxbt has now provided much more detail. With what we know, this is not in any way an exception, and there are so many hypocritical and corrupt(ed) influencers who all pretend to be reputable. They are not.

2,26,project,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
3,26,project,1/2 What are the reasons that founders don’t want to dox themselves? It allows them to walk away from the project without any reputational damage and do it again. Or it allows others to dig into their past (IRL or in the NFT space) and find some of their skeletons in the closet.
4,26,project,"Almost every day for two weeks, a new project founder has dm’d me looking for moral support after dealing with intense harassment. We need to cultivate a culture that maintains a certain level of respect for each other as humans - mental health isn’t something you can buy. 1/"
