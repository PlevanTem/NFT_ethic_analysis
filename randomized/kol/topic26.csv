0,26,supply,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
1,26,supply,@realhumankinder Positive: probably ethical visibility for industries like clothing and their supply chains. A restructuring of power dynamics and wealth. Negative: maybe the decentralised nature allows easy funding for terrible things?

We noticed that your old twitter handle @023 is suspended, but we did like the photo with your $900k watch. https://t.co/HIkXV3btAg"

0,26,power,17/ They will soon become so (financially) powerful and influential that they determine the (ethical) direction of this space. They will become too big to fail in this space.
1,26,power,"1/ Some people contacted us to ask our opinion on @moonbirds_xyz that is minting tomorrow for 2.5 ETH, which would take out more than 75 million USD out of the ecosystem. As usual, many are afraid to speak out because they don't want to offend ""powerful"" Web3/NFT influencers/VCs. https://t.co/YXvAqs8mwn"

3,26,art,"A good reminder again that scammers, fraudsters and con artists are generally never original. They (re)use or (re)cycle ideas that others created and when found out, they always provide the same excuses as well. Hyping and manipulating is where they excel.

1,26,project,"Soon we will report about 3 scam rings originating from the same country (UAE) that have been responsible for &gt;4 rug pulls each (3D projects). Mainly french speaking with connections to Canada/France. Some have &gt;4M followers on IG. We will report names, so it requires more rigor."
2,26,project,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.
