1,27,good,"Just for the avoidance of doubt. The verified account @BhawanaCAN is an obvious scam promoting an ""Ape Coin airdrop"" and also the verified account of @ToddWasserman has been hacked and used for scamming.
Almost nothing is what it seems, and if it seems too good to be true, it is. https://t.co/skw6d6jnFi"
2,27,good,"#UnikGals not only raise awareness about maternal #mentalhealth. We also promote #inclusion and diversity in all terms 💜

There is no equality without #disability inclusion 💜

3,27,good,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately “survive”, so the current state of the market is that “bad news” for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
4,27,good,"1/2 Never get deceived by seemingly good gestures. There is a scammer out there (twitter handle: LurkingisNicer), who rugged the @ElephantNFTS  project and put in his Twitter profile that he donated $50k to charity. He scammer someone recently out of $8000 https://t.co/MeYIAVaGl1 https://t.co/FDKHtPD02b"

0,27,really,"@flynnkristina @Science_stanley @rollnwthehomies @some_place @LanaHopkins3 @jdisimone_ Considering accessibilty needs whatever we're developing in the space. It's really important to normalise disability inclusion &amp; talking about it in the context of equity &amp; diversity. We're talking 1.2B ppl. I often face the problem of ""charitable"" as soon as I mention disability"
1,27,really,We would greatly appreciate if you could go through all our thousands of spam emails each day and provide proof if they are legit or not. There might be one where someone really wants to send $10M to my bank account and split the difference as a thank you https://t.co/MtP07inymb
2,27,really,"8/ We see a lot of messages about inclusive, but when you start a Dutch Auction at 3.33 ETH (those who buy early will be able to snap up the rare traits), you are favoring the rich and are not really ""inclusive"". https://t.co/0Y1pnt7bxZ"
3,27,really,"6/ We can’t really find anything about this company which claims to be the number 1 Instagram growth agency, and the only reasonably long and neutral review is pretty negative. https://t.co/KxGt0yGWBm"

0,27,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
1,27,transparent,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.

3,27,transparent,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."

1,27,make,"@NFTherder We specifically mentioned that people NEW to the NFT space shouldn't mint any project, because they won't be able to make a proper distinction between legit and scam projects. If they would do that, it would harm the NFT space far more long-term than our short term warning."
2,27,make,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let’s hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don’t have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else. You might want to review some of your past digital tracks to make that not too easy...
3,27,make,"1/ This is going to be a bit of a controversial thread, so just some disclaimers. We are free speech maximalists and “truths” can be inconvenient or politically incorrect, which could make them to certain people “offensive”, but it doesn’t make them less “true”."

1,27,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
2,27,trust,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

1,27,nft,@Ape7068 @psych_nft You would prefer me to ask women not to reduce men to their marital status to be fair despite it not being a thing? Assuming equality doesn’t make it so. Men’s accomplishments are never eclipsed by their marital status.

2,27,project,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."
3,27,project,"15/ This is not a Dutch Auction in the true sense of the word and certainly not when the earlier you buy, the more rare your NFT will be. It is however an example of how the NFT space works: a few ""insiders"" are hyping ventures/projects/artists, and they benefit the most."
