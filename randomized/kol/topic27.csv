0,moral,"Almost every day for two weeks, a new project founder has dm‚Äôd me looking for moral support after dealing with intense harassment. We need to cultivate a culture that maintains a certain level of respect for each other as humans - mental health isn‚Äôt something you can buy. 1/"
1,moral,"15/ Also with his current company he has shown that his moral compass is not pointing in the right direction, but if you have a net worth of over $13 billion, not many people are able to stand up against someone with so much money and influence. Some successfully did however. https://t.co/bMVmDsxA8b"
2,moral,There‚Äôs a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would do this without those people. üíñ

4,moral,"@BoredApe1000 @larvalabs The morality of the situation is exactly what I am questioning. Why would you sell something that you created and intend on deeming worthless? It's no different to selling a lemon. 

They should have just burnt them."
0,like,"@WarewaPain @TheMetaTribes 99.9% likely it's a scam. 8 tweets, no website, no Discord and 54300 followers on Twitter, while not following anyone else. It's the same cartel of scammers - avoid at all costs. https://t.co/O5wkxKIrVv"
1,like,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1
2,like,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don‚Äôt believe in gatekeeping. 

Here‚Äôs a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] üßµüëáüèΩ"
3,like,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
4,like,"1/ Dear Haya - as you are one of the founders of @diverse, and someone with almost 4M followers on IG before it was inactivated, we have a couple of quick questions. We noticed that your old twitter handle @023 is suspended, but we did like the photo with your $900k watch. https://t.co/HIkXV3btAg"
0,invest,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name. It is obvious in whose possession those valuable domain names are or were in case they have been resold. The domains were listed on https://t.co/bpvWhH592q. https://t.co/dUgpCIuQqk"
1,invest,"@arvinlolme @NFTherder Yes, in the thread he mentions that 3 months ago he made you aware of this and that nothing has been done yet. A bit more pro-activity wouldn't hurt don't you think? Certainly given the small investment it requires and the huge amount of primary/secondary sales in comparison."
2,invest,"13/ More than 700 wealthy Russians obtained British citizenship between 2008 and 2015 as part of a program that granted visas to foreigners in exchange for investments in real estate. ""Dirty"" money and real estate also became more entangled. https://t.co/I7u6VzZzfn"
3,invest,"3/ The tweets by @gmcapital_ have now all been conveniently deleted, but many people were planning to invest in this fund and we potentially saved them tens of millions of dollars. We explicitly mentioned this as a justification for his doxxing https://t.co/t8bn2QXNiQ"
4,invest,"Elon Musk wanting to buy Twitter fits into the more common trend of billionaires wanting to buy clout via media companies: Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, Changpeng Zhao (Binance) ""invested"" $200 million in Forbes. Not the ""truth"" matters, but how many you can ""influence""."

0,money,"9/ We have received confirmation from multiple independent sources that Marc Cuban's @NFT venture offered equity to projects that had the potential to sell out. That would also explain why they received so much money from certain projects and why they did so much ""due diligence"". https://t.co/zlFX9mwfXM"
1,money,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It‚Äôs a similar thing imo
2,money,11/ Zagabond was asked about all the ICO scams and said: ‚Äúyou should at least have done as much work as you could have done on the project before trying to raise money‚Äù. Maybe he also forgot about that when raising money with his NFT projects and abandoning them. https://t.co/LfuM2qverZ
3,money,"@0xQuit Many people are often not able to predict in advance which projects are ""going to help us build"", certainly not when the founders are undoxxed. Less or no money upfront means less incentive to scam, and almost no liquidity drain. Now it's 0% risk for founders, 100% for holders."
4,money,"5/ It would explain why they spent so much money on traveling and also why the whole team had to go there. It also shows bad intent, because if the funds were going to be re-invested, it wouldn't be taxable income. https://t.co/vbGfHbgLUr"
0,trust,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because ‚Äúthere's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn‚Äôt think that that would also apply to the ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"

1,project,"1/4 Twitter has become the primary vehicle for scammers to get attention for their NFT project. Many of us will quite quickly be able to see whether a Twitter account belongs to scammers or not, in the same way that most people are quickly able to identify email spam."
2,project,"We estimate that over 80% of all NFT projects coming out now are scams. If we don't explicitly mention that a project is a scam, it doesn't at all mean that it isn't a scam. We simply don't have the time/resources to mention them all. We hope people start to see the common signs."
