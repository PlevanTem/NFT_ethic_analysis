0,27,good,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility ü§ùüíñ"
1,27,good,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.

PixelSaurus is a diverse and inclusive project that also embraces disability &amp; mental health issues. Add up to 3 traits to your #NFTs, too!

3,27,good,"4/ A project that started off as a scam, can still become successful (for unexpected reasons) to a degree that the founders (or persons in charge) think it‚Äôs worthwhile to continue it. In the same way projects that started with only good intentions can still fail dramatically."

We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.

1,27,really,14/ Many people now start to notice that our statement below was not an exaggeration. It served as a real warning to really do your research and see the characteristics that all these scam projects have in common (in the same way you distinguish spam emails from legit ones). https://t.co/gyYHnKYMEH

3,27,really,"8/ We see a lot of messages about inclusive, but when you start a Dutch Auction at 3.33 ETH (those who buy early will be able to snap up the rare traits), you are favoring the rich and are not really ""inclusive"". https://t.co/0Y1pnt7bxZ"
4,27,really,"@NFTethics @moonbirds_xyz I‚Äôm gutted because when you first came into the scene you wrote good shit and it was a real prevention mechanism for future scammers. 

Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It‚Äôs a shame really."
0,27,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn‚Äôt equate to inorganic growth imo - it‚Äôs a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won‚Äôt work the next but as long as you‚Äôre authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you‚Äôre good
1,27,transparent,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
2,27,transparent,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
3,27,transparent,"1/ It‚Äôs sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn‚Äôt stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
4,27,transparent,"We need a non-profit advertising service that applies some level of due-diligence on the projects it promotes with standardised and transparent fees. 

All profits go to charity. 

I'd work on this for free if people are interested hmu."

3,27,blue,1/ Our idea to make this space more ethical is by making morality more valuable than money in the future. It will pay off to behave ethically and it will cost you if you behave immorally. We provide a decentralized self-regulatory blueprint as a starting point for discussion.
4,27,blue,"It looks like the SEC's experience with @ElonMusk, the owner of the first NFT Company or Company NFT that was shilled on Twitter, will likely serve as a blueprint for the future regulation of NFTs. More background here: https://t.co/KU17A6PENE"
0,27,make,@Ape7068 @psych_nft You would prefer me to ask women not to reduce men to their marital status to be fair despite it not being a thing? Assuming equality doesn‚Äôt make it so. Men‚Äôs accomplishments are never eclipsed by their marital status.

3,27,make,"@LupianoTrip Yes, we receive around 200 DMs per day. We read them all, but have to make priorities in terms of what we think is most worthwhile researching into. But all the information has allowed us to get a good understanding of the space. And Twitter's recent DM search feature has helped."

Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it‚Äôs almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn‚Äôt established."
3,27,trust,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
4,27,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
