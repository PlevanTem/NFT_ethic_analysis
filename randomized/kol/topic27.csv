PixelSaurus is a diverse and inclusive project that also embraces disability &amp; mental health issues. Add up to 3 traits to your #NFTs, too!

1,27,good,"Just for the avoidance of doubt. The verified account @BhawanaCAN is an obvious scam promoting an ""Ape Coin airdrop"" and also the verified account of @ToddWasserman has been hacked and used for scamming.
Almost nothing is what it seems, and if it seems too good to be true, it is. https://t.co/skw6d6jnFi"

3,27,good,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù, so the current state of the market is that ‚Äúbad news‚Äù for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
4,27,good,"1/2 Never get deceived by seemingly good gestures. There is a scammer out there (twitter handle: LurkingisNicer), who rugged the @ElephantNFTS  project and put in his Twitter profile that he donated $50k to charity.

0,27,really,"@flynnkristina @Science_stanley @rollnwthehomies @some_place @LanaHopkins3 @jdisimone_ Considering accessibilty needs whatever we're developing in the space. It's really important to normalise disability inclusion &amp; talking about it in the context of equity &amp; diversity. We're talking 1.2B ppl. I often face the problem of ""charitable"" as soon as I mention disability"
1,27,really,We would greatly appreciate if you could go through all our thousands of spam emails each day and provide proof if they are legit or not. There might be one where someone really wants to send $10M to my bank account and split the difference as a thank you https://t.co/MtP07inymb
2,27,really,"8/ We see a lot of messages about inclusive, but when you start a Dutch Auction at 3.33 ETH (those who buy early will be able to snap up the rare traits), you are favoring the rich and are not really ""inclusive"". https://t.co/0Y1pnt7bxZ"

1,27,transparent,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.

1,27,make,"@NFTherder We specifically mentioned that people NEW to the NFT space shouldn't mint any project, because they won't be able to make a proper distinction between legit and scam projects. If they would do that, it would harm the NFT space far more long-term than our short term warning."
2,27,make,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let‚Äôs hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don‚Äôt have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else. You might want to review some of your past digital tracks to make that not too easy...

2,27,trust,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.
