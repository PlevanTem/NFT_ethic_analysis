But certain apps show the name based on your phone number... https://t.co/aWtEDRq5A4"
0,27,bird,"1/ Some people contacted us to ask our opinion on @moonbirds_xyz that is minting tomorrow for 2.5 ETH, which would take out more than 75 million USD out of the ecosystem. As usual, many are afraid to speak out because they don't want to offend ""powerful"" Web3/NFT influencers/VCs. https://t.co/YXvAqs8mwn"
1,27,bird,"@NFTethics @moonbirds_xyz I’m gutted because when you first came into the scene you wrote good shit and it was a real prevention mechanism for future scammers. 

Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It’s a shame really."
0,27,clothes,"9/ When looking at Zagabond’s digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ"

1,27,community,"Many prominent people active in the NFT space who frequently say “WAGMI” and “Care for the community”, really mean: we need everyone to believe this so that they fill up the liquidity pool that I want to drain. 

They claim to like decentralization, but only for selfish purposes."
2,27,community,"Of course @DoodlesCatsNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community, no website, nothing. When you have (serious) doubts about a project, avoid. https://t.co/ffwvprkZ9u"
3,27,community,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.

🌈Unlearning unconscious bias 
🌈Advice for aspiring leaders

0,27,belief,"2/ Contrary to popular belief, we have no problem with capitalism and we don’t like hypocritical governments and their civil servants who milk the tax system to pay their salaries and justify their own existence."
1,27,belief,Full transparency: we had full belief and intention the reveal would happen when we said - the massive amount of variance proved to be a way larger job to sign off than anticipated. The collection is amazing. It will reveal within the next day when the team has slept.
2,27,belief,"There's a fine line between condemning cancel culture and cultural insensitivity. 

If you are someone who hasn't personally suffered discrimination in your life, then who are you to judge? 

I'm all for freedom of beliefs but branding everything as cancel culture is not right."
