0,28,basic,"10/ If someone asks about why they initially announced an astronaut to be part of the project, one of the founders said he screwed up and asks an ambassador to better answer the question. The ambassador then basically says: wait till after mint and then we go to the moon. https://t.co/G5CucS65CT"
1,28,basic,"2/ The person in question is MontanaBlack with 1.1M Twitter followers. He basically says he didn't know it was a scam, and couldn't believe it was because it was so ""hyped"". He was happy that others pointed out it was a scam before everything sold out. And DYOR of course!"
2,28,basic,"11/ So Greg Solano is basically the only person that could provide us with some hints. Solano has written quite a lot of poetry and book reviews, co-authored a book about World of Warcraft, and we also noticed a blog that he used to write. https://t.co/Gm0vfUS0Y7"
3,28,basic,"22/ Transparency pervades all domains and each person will be asked to provide certain basic input such as your wallet addresses, disclosures about (financial) relationships with (past/future) projects, alpha groups and/or other influencers (and their wallets)."
4,28,basic,"4/ She basically provides 2 justifications for why this can’t be true: the BAYC founders all have immigrant backgrounds (Cuban, Jewish, Pakistani &amp; Turkish) and the person who accused them of this, Ryder Ripps, has an underlying agenda to do this."
0,28,ape,"You can’t escape the thought that Yuga Labs changed the Dutch Auction to a flat price of 305 ApeCoin, because they were afraid that the DA would go down to a level that wouldn’t allow Marc Andreessen to purchase yet another house. He already bought 3 houses, so 5 more to go: 305. https://t.co/EKk6UuwwoW"
1,28,ape,"53/ The investment vehicle that he used for TokenPay was Huntingdon Investment Corp, registered on the British Virgin Islands on the same address as TokenPay. The address is also included in the Panama papers. The whitepaper mentions the how critical this ""partner"" was. https://t.co/TF6TU1Mcck"
2,28,ape,"There are apparently lots of new people in the NFT space since February, because the video that is going around has already long proven to be completely fake and fabricated. We have never taken any money from anyone in any shape or form and never will.

3,28,ape,"26/ The company RGT itself is registered in Panama, with an officer of an offshore entity who is also mentioned in the Panama papers. That will become a recurrent pattern: Beanie generally always hides behind someone else (or a proxy). https://t.co/nGBwCyo7mp"
4,28,ape,"The response from @bapesclan to our thread was disappointing to say the least (screenshots and voice: https://t.co/FJxkkBiZo3)

Thanks to @Rug_Watch, also for finding a Covid-scam that another founder was involved in. He has deleted his tweet (as usual).

0,28,belong,"1/4 Twitter has become the primary vehicle for scammers to get attention for their NFT project. Many of us will quite quickly be able to see whether a Twitter account belongs to scammers or not, in the same way that most people are quickly able to identify email spam."

0,28,bother,"Just warning people for an upcoming rug called @theshifters_. We wrote a complete thread about them and they didn't even bother to respond: https://t.co/NHOQo3C85P

The project has so many red flags, and we didn't even mention all the fake Twitter profiles (see screenshots) https://t.co/bykBDYLrmy"
0,28,code,"2/ One of the reasons why we decided to release the information is that we had serious doubts about the existence of his investment fund. Apart from Beanie's background, the ISIN number did not match any database records and also consisted of 3 country code letters instead of 2 https://t.co/PH6gxTBaD2"
