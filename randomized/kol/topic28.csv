0,good,"1/ Before our upcoming thread about VCs, we thought it would be good to first give some additional background to further understand the context and connections that we will be making. It’s a simplified version for brevity purposes."
1,good,"A good reminder again that scammers, fraudsters and con artists are generally never original. They (re)use or (re)cycle ideas that others created and when found out, they always provide the same excuses as well. Hyping and manipulating is where they excel.

3,good,"6/ Serena is very good friends with Chris Lyons, the partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) who is now also at the board of Yuga Labs. Serena herself has just raised $111 million for her own VC, and at least one of her staff members was introduced via a16z. https://t.co/4KGI7ivMt9"
4,good,"12/ Some people have complained about the time when their Discord got hacked, which didn't contribute to a ""good vibe"", but this is a minor point as almost no project can say these days anymore that their Discord hasn't been hacked. https://t.co/sjNIWaYs2r"

2,right,"3/ We can understand the logic behind it, and also we are fallible to the same “flaw”. When we report something, we might be 95% “right” but there could be collateral damage. You can’t check each &amp; every detail (certainly not with NFTs) and these details can also change over time"
3,right,"1/ We have a couple of questions for @MoonPay/@isotowright, and its concierge service that a lot of celebrities already seem to have used to purchase some high value NFTs. We created a non-exhaustive list of these celebrities below. https://t.co/8Qi5k1fRln"
4,right,"15/ Also with his current company he has shown that his moral compass is not pointing in the right direction, but if you have a net worth of over $13 billion, not many people are able to stand up against someone with so much money and influence. Some successfully did however. https://t.co/bMVmDsxA8b"
0,space,"7/ We are aware of the sensitivity of doxing someone in the Web3 space, and we recently gave someone a subtle warning. It avoids that you potentially harm someone’s career and project (including their holders), and it serves as an incentive for the person to behave ethically."

4,space,"24/ Linda Xie is very well connected in the NFT space, is a personal investor in OpenSea, a ""close friend of a16z” (in a16z’s own words). Zagabond quit his job at 0x Labs in September and was congratulated on Twitter by Linda Xie and Will Warren. https://t.co/SfDOtnvQ0P"
0,know,"20/ When we deal with (anon) people that we only know via digital interactions, we often fill in the things we don’t know in the most favorable way we imagine. We project our own fantasies to fill in the blanks, which is part of the reason why good people are so often scammed."
1,know,"9/ The Daily Mail didn’t publish anything about the restraining order because of that, so if you ever wonder why all these billionaires want to buy media companies (Forbes, Times Magazine, Washington Post, etc.), you now know the answer. https://t.co/m6Q5OgHQs7 https://t.co/Dqlo1CAFuI"
2,know,I’d love to know who your favourite women and gender diverse artists are ✨
3,know,"15/ Just so that people know, @NFT asked $20000-$25000 per IG post and the minimum amount was 5 posts, to they would rake in anyway $100k- $125k per project! They also suggested that more posts is relatively cheaper, so ideal for scammers with multiple projects. https://t.co/pe18LOJWDy"
4,know,"2/ No roadmap other than some abstract nonsense, and claiming they are backed by Fortune 500 companies, VCs, investors, traders, but of course there is 0 evidence of that. Claiming they will use the profits for charity as well - we all know that that means. https://t.co/ZqzEhddSYS"
0,thing,"Of course UnscratchedNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community (5 tweets), banning people, empty promises, etc. https://t.co/QRFCOa4Q7m https://t.co/j0lpRJmXG9"
1,thing,"@arvinlolme @NFTherder Yes, in the thread he mentions that 3 months ago he made you aware of this and that nothing has been done yet. A bit more pro-activity wouldn't hurt don't you think? Certainly given the small investment it requires and the huge amount of primary/secondary sales in comparison."

3,thing,"14/ Pluck engaged a streamer (Khanada) who has lost everything in the esports space as he was banned from Twitch for his violent threats/bullying behavior, and then also banned from Youtube. https://t.co/Rslq1BtKaS"
4,thing,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
0,money,"15/ These projects either have the same (or connected) founders or are based on playbooks that you can purchase in the in the “criminal circuit”. How to earn easy, quick and large amounts of money with NFTs anonymously? This playbook shows you how."
1,money,@kmoney_69 Trust your gut. It’s hard to differentiate anxiety from intuition at times but you got this.
2,money,15/ Or you can pay a one-off “fine” to increase your TRUSTH score and compensate for all the errors of judgement that you made in the past. The money will be distributed to those with a high(er) TRUSTH score that were affected by your wallet transactions.
3,money,"4/ Anyway, many VCs these days serve as money laundering factories for dirty (offshore) money and Web3 is a casino that they built that could serve this purpose. We can’t wait to see how this space evolves by the VCs whose greed is only surpassed by their infinite hypocrisy."
4,money,"9/ When looking at Zagabond’s digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ"

0,lot,"13/ We came with a bold warning a week ago for NEW people not to mint any project for 2 weeks. We received a lot of criticism for that, but because of so many tips that we received, our “opinion” was well-informed (in our opinion). Again, it’s always a trade-off. https://t.co/ZJJQ6GZQvi"
1,lot,3/ These individuals often get their credibility from the fact that they (A) have a lot of followers and (B) their PFP is considered to be very reputable (e.g. BAYC/CryptoPunk). Below are some examples of such persons (they frequently change their Twitter handles). https://t.co/oeQv8eafgv
2,lot,"Marc Andreessen (a16z) talks a lot about how much he loves ""free speech"" on Twitter, but when the Saudi government ordered Khashoggi's assassination for exercising his free speech, Marc remained on the advisory board of NEOM, a project worth $500 billion and declined any comment. https://t.co/YIcn47IjHF"
3,lot,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust. This is a tactic that Beanie is well aware of and frequently uses."

2,people,"19/ Some people want us to dox ourselves so that they can silence us IRL, something they tried but couldn’t do digitally. Others have questioned our credibility or ulterior motives."
3,people,Imagine that anyone in the world forwards you emails from their spam folder and asks you whether that email is legit or not. That is exactly how our inbox looks like. Lots of new people in this space that are not aware that lots of bad actors have joined the NFT space as well.
4,people,1/ Later today @mcuban is one of the speakers on the NFTLA event and this is a reminder that 'his' @NFT page was responsible for many scams/rugs and many new people wanting to join the NFT space will likely have left the ecosystem because of this. https://t.co/YxyDhETQXb

2,trust,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
