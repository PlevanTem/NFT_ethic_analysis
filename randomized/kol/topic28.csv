0,28,ago,"We were away for some days, but when we wrote the below message a couple of weeks ago, it was meant to be a warning for what we are currently seeing in the crypto/NFT/Web3 space. If you know the people/VCs involved, it shouldn't really come as a surprise.

https://t.co/Uh3Lcqu7Co"
1,28,ago,4/ Did you know that technically a16z is not a VC anymore? They changed a couple of years ago to a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). Little wonder the powerful VC lobby group the NVCA has been talking to the SEC into changing its definition of what constitutes a VC firm. https://t.co/aI9DAmhl00
2,28,ago,"63/ He also revealed to have run the largest hacker IRC, that he moved out of Canada more than 22 years ago for tax reasons, and that he has 30 years of professional trolling. https://t.co/xARwEx00Js"
3,28,ago,"Dear @LesleySilverman, as the Head of Digital Assets at UTA and formally representing Larva Labs' IP, did you think it was appropriate for you to purchase 2 Meebits 9 days ago? What does @unitedtalent think about employees that use insider information to gain an unfair advantage? https://t.co/LPUxcInUmK"
4,28,ago,"1/ Sometimes there are brilliant individuals out there who really take the time and effort to check connections between wallets and projects. Already 2 months ago, someone created the below chart and dropped it in the Ancient Cats Club Discord after it was rugged. https://t.co/jU3Xmgafxa"
0,28,say,"Many prominent people active in the NFT space who frequently say ‚ÄúWAGMI‚Äù and ‚ÄúCare for the community‚Äù, really mean: we need everyone to believe this so that they fill up the liquidity pool that I want to drain. 

They claim to like decentralization, but only for selfish purposes."
1,28,say,1/ A quick thread about the importance and current lack of ethics in the NFT space. We have noticed that a lot of the same persons are involved in multiple rugs. It‚Äôs probably even fair to say that there is a very small cartel of influential players that are serial ruggers.
2,28,say,"4/ As usual it starts by saying that it‚Äôs all lies, and that he has done many good things for the NFT space, and even spent $250k+ supporting ""unknown emerging"" 1/1 NFT artists from ""underdeveloped countries"". The phony philanthropy always speak volumes. https://t.co/X5IHK2CLML https://t.co/0hhKUGdg2W"
3,28,say,"We thought that the irony was obvious, but around 50% of the people didn't get it looking at the comments.

We meant to say: don't mint this stuff. They are not on LinkedIn.

If you don't get obvious irony, how can you see through not so obvious scams?

https://t.co/bRk1kqsWUJ"
4,28,say,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F
0,28,right,"We knew his identity and ""track record"" (as far as you can speak of that when you are 19/20 years old) already for quite a while, but had hoped that he (and his father) would have made the right decision...

https://t.co/INEvVHLab1"
1,28,right,"2/ The CEO of MoonPay, @isotowright, gave an interview with @theblock__, but some of the questions were not (properly) answered, so we would like to ask these questions again. The article can be found here (and we will refer to it in the tweets below): https://t.co/NIsofaeOtN"
2,28,right,"The Web3/NFT space can be regarded as a microcosm of the VC world based on the right connections, buying low &amp; selling high, over-hyping and lots of phony philanthropy &amp; fake positivity. We will soon shine a light on all the VCs/individuals involved in pushing this space forward."
3,28,right,11/ We called out MontanaBlack with his &gt;20M followers and his right-hand man. The latter deleted or changed his Twitter account immediately afterwards. https://t.co/JkUIiPooOV
4,28,right,"16/ We stumbled upon 4chan threads from 2014 &amp; 2016 that mentioned the term ‚ÄúKali Yuga‚Äù and a French far right politician tweeted about it in 2015. In July 2019, a Telegram group called the ""Kali Yuga Surfing Club"" opened, featuring alt-right/Nazi-centric memes. https://t.co/muPNRGbJqY"

3,28,year,"Someone sees HypeFriends (HF) using 2-year old art and asks them: is this your artist? ""Yes, it's our designer"", they say! Then we ask @Lomax71809176 and he tells HF stole his art. HF then quickly deletes their tweets and turns the story around: he left us 2 weeks ago. Red Flag! https://t.co/5bszFxlJW8"
4,28,year,"2/ And thread 2 (which mentions that their ""biggest client is @reshadeth a 15 year old""). It involves (in)direct proof of identity fraud, getting around KYC/AML laws, wire fraud, giving and/or receiving capital assets to a minor which legally cannot invest
https://t.co/6SRAIKiD5m https://t.co/P14TgEQxW1"
0,28,thing,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You‚Äôre right, we‚Äôre all learning. It‚Äôs good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it‚Äôs almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn‚Äôt established."
1,28,thing,"17/ Gargamel mentioned in an interview that they ""knew all about what this world was"", things are not ""just random"" which can also be concluded from the complicated puzzle that BAYC posted that ultimately could only be deciphered by a team of professionals https://t.co/rtp0fdAY6t https://t.co/oYjLHfDYty"
2,28,thing,"25/ It starts to become a space created by unethical people for unethical people. We have many powerful/unethical enemies, but we have even more powerless/ethical friends. We have used this account to protect that latter category against the former. Nothing more and nothing less."
3,28,thing,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.
4,28,thing,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
0,28,money,17/ You don‚Äôt have to be a genius to understand that a lot of that dirty money has been shifted to crypto and that the art world is notorious for its corruption and money laundering potential: https://t.co/83vlBonyHK https://t.co/BBUfOUMfnU
1,28,money,1/ Our idea to make this space more ethical is by making morality more valuable than money in the future. It will pay off to behave ethically and it will cost you if you behave immorally. We provide a decentralized self-regulatory blueprint as a starting point for discussion.
2,28,money,"9/ When looking at Zagabond‚Äôs digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ"
3,28,money,"4/ This example highlights the issue of ‚Äúperverse incentives‚Äù. Founders get most of the money during the minting process when the project is only based on ‚Äúhype‚Äù. This continue during the ‚Äúhoneymoon period‚Äù, when still a lot of things are promised and OS royalties are flowing in."
4,28,money,"23/ We do think that it is problematic when we don‚Äôt know the ulterior ideology/intentions of the founders, certainly when so much money is involved and all these opportunistic VCs and celebrities are blindly aping into this project. More clarity should be provided."
0,28,know,"3/ This is not the best way of using our time. Many scammers, fraudsters, thieves and criminals IRL are behaving in the same in the digital world, so it only confirms what most will already know. There are also too many to report about."
1,28,know,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.

https://t.co/HjnfLA5kY0 https://t.co/4dPqEIIWop"
2,28,know,"15/ Just so that people know, @NFT asked $20000-$25000 per IG post and the minimum amount was 5 posts, to they would rake in anyway $100k- $125k per project! They also suggested that more posts is relatively cheaper, so ideal for scammers with multiple projects. https://t.co/pe18LOJWDy"
3,28,know,@RijksdaalderNFT Because there is no centralized entity that keeps track of each project either in advance of minting or afterwards. Also no one knows the connections IRL between the founders and funders of all these projects. They are all in some way (inter)connected.
4,28,know,"3/ One profile clearly shows involvement in this project and his real Twitter account is screenshotted below. The reason we know this is that when he handed over the project to the community, people discovered this. https://t.co/JvDzlrchti"
0,28,people,"History will judge very hard on big social media influencers on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc., pretending to be reputable and reliable, for selling a young generation of naive and easily influenced people worthless NFTs for tens of millions of dollars."
1,28,people,"When you spend too much time solely on CT it's easy to forget how correlated crypto is to equities, other risk assets and sentiment. Just never see many people talking about it on my feed."

3,28,people,"Why scammers &amp; fraudsters thrive? Research shows that people tend to default to trusting others over distrusting them, believing them over doubting them and going along with someone‚Äôs self-presentation rather than embarrassing them by calling them out. https://t.co/KAu7BQh7JG"
4,28,people,13/ Why is it interesting? Because the people behind Meta4Capital don‚Äôt seem to have the best reputation. There is quite a lot of communication with the SEC regarding their other company Rokk3r and they had to pay a significant fine. But it gets worse. https://t.co/CCNkOmmONc

0,28,trust,You can always trust @beaniemaxi to not miss out on a good trade üß†
1,28,trust,6/ Let‚Äôs start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
2,28,trust,"We were contacted by a member of the community who said they claimed the original account for us, and has since handed over the handle. 
We didn‚Äôt trust this right away due to the murkiness of the entire situation."
3,28,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
4,28,trust,@beaniemaxi @mando_great @BoredApeYC @coolcatsnft @MetaHero_ @pixelvault_ @punkscomic @Matt_Furie @AvidLines @CryptoKitties @XCOPYART @fewocious @videodrome @Gfunkera86 We love the @pixelvault_! We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
