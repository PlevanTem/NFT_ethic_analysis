0,28,ago,"18/ This whole story is made even worse when you see an interview that Jason Falovitch did a couple of months ago. Not sure why he is filmed in something that looks like a prison cell, but maybe he is preparing for what is coming. https://t.co/XoPfu2lzG8"
1,28,ago,"63/ He also revealed to have run the largest hacker IRC, that he moved out of Canada more than 22 years ago for tax reasons, and that he has 30 years of professional trolling. https://t.co/xARwEx00Js"
2,28,ago,"17/ But it gets worse: The Block posted an article a couple of years ago about the connection between Coinbase, 0x Labs and Scalar Capital. They have removed that article, maybe because Mike Dudas now has his own fund backed by a16z. https://t.co/y3mXpKseMJ"
3,28,ago,"More than 3 months ago, the ratio of well intentioned projects and bad intentioned ones was probably around 80%-20%. 

That ratio has in our view shifted: 80% are now likely scams and 20% are projects that really want to build something.

This makes sense:

4,28,ago,"Today @SerpentAU says that he was never banned from Fortnite. Almost two years ago he said he was banned.

Today he says that ""there was no violation of the terms of services"", but two years ago he was even dropped by his own organization Overtime Gaming.

0,28,say,Trust me when I say all you gotta do is survive in bear mkts.
1,28,say,"When people say they love decentralization, it's often because they are part of a centralized narrative from a centralized network that requires you to exchange your currently ""centralized"" FIAT money to crypto, so that they can (ab)use that in a ""centralized"" way. The irony."
2,28,say,@ThroughLurking @camolNFT @itstylersays @farokh @tropoFarmer @ElectionDayMad1 Looking forward to that. Spending our time exposing some lowlife scammers is not very intellectually stimulating.
3,28,say,"We thought that the irony was obvious, but around 50% of the people didn't get it looking at the comments.

We meant to say: don't mint this stuff. They are not on LinkedIn.

If you don't get obvious irony, how can you see through not so obvious scams?

4,28,say,"20/ Many influencers &amp; artists don‚Äôt care about where the money is coming from or is going (hint: LooksRare). As long as they make money and people buy their art for enormous amounts, they are happy to say how great and beneficial NFTs are. Changing the narrative sometimes helps. https://t.co/GaDdk4UlFs"

3,28,year,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
4,28,year,"10/ With the Russia-Ukraine war, we can see the grander scale of the hypocrisy that has always existed and how many of these countries have benefited for years by taking on ‚Äúdirty‚Äù money from rich individuals. https://t.co/ufJnFzhIPa"
0,28,thing,"10/ We did indeed find that also Gregory Solano also graduated from the University of Maryland, and didn‚Äôt find anything about Wylie Aranow, apart from the fact that his father was very (in)famous and some of the info he revealed in interviews (""his gambling-problem days""). https://t.co/LyF9VFtQCQ"
1,28,thing,"Of course @DoodlesCatsNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community, no website, nothing. When you have (serious) doubts about a project, avoid. https://t.co/ffwvprkZ9u"
2,28,thing,"Quite a few people that claim to be or are perceived as ‚ÄúArtists‚Äù often forget to put the word ‚ÄúCon‚Äù in front of their supposed profession. Not everything that you can imagine is real ‚Äì it‚Äôs often just fake, false and fraudulent. Intelligence has its limits, but stupidity not. https://t.co/JR8SbHmXoB"
3,28,thing,Cultural and social significance of something play huge roles in how we determine value. As does bias. These same concepts apply to digital items in an increasingly digital world.
4,28,thing,"8/ This is already known for decades, but for a variety of reasons governments have chosen not to do anything about it. The wealthy have a lot of influence. It is complex as countries are also competing with each other in terms of favorable tax regimes."
0,28,money,"21/ If anyone tries to make any critical comment about it, they are completely ridiculed. But others can freely say that no one cares about art and it‚Äôs all about the money. Being hypocritical has become an art in itself in this space. https://t.co/CHikSJRnyR"
1,28,money,2. Equities = you own a share of the company and may get paid dividends/benefit in capital appreciation from growth. Bonds/loans = you lend money to a company and get paid interest. Obviously there are various financial ratios we use to help us get to a concept of valuation.
2,28,money,11/ Zagabond was asked about all the ICO scams and said: ‚Äúyou should at least have done as much work as you could have done on the project before trying to raise money‚Äù. Maybe he also forgot about that when raising money with his NFT projects and abandoning them. https://t.co/LfuM2qverZ
3,28,money,"16/ According to the IMF that provides a conservative estimation that between $600 billion and 1.5 trillion USD of illicit money is laundered, with most drug money going through offhore &amp; lesser regulated jurisdictions such as Paraguay, UAE and even the USA. https://t.co/k5i1kg1gxJ"

0,28,know,There‚Äôs a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would do this without those people. üíñ
1,28,know,"We wonder if the two @LooksRareNFT founders, Guts and @ZoddLooksRare, would be willing to give some clarification on why they seem to use a Chinese proxy for their company filings in the UK and Canada. And whether all the influencer investors in LooksRare know their identities. https://t.co/IxUePOH66f"
2,28,know,"10/ We know a lot of the true identities behind all the NFT aliases, but writing threads such as the one about Beanie are very time-consuming. And selecting only one individual to highlight and expose will always be arbitrary, because why that person and not the other one?"
3,28,know,"20/ When we deal with (anon) people that we only know via digital interactions, we often fill in the things we don‚Äôt know in the most favorable way we imagine. We project our own fantasies to fill in the blanks, which is part of the reason why good people are so often scammed."

2,28,trust,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.
3,28,trust,"Btw, I'd strongly recommend learning to use @flipsfinance. We're gonna put out some tutorials on it soon but I would really really recommend getting proficient at it; trust me you'll want to!"
4,28,trust,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You‚Äôre right, we‚Äôre all learning. It‚Äôs good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it‚Äôs almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn‚Äôt established."
