1,long,"1/ Maybe it's interesting to mention some background on Crypto888crypto, someone already quite long active in the crypto world by shilling low Market Cap (MC) alt coins. He has deleted many tweets and also confirmed that, but we still have them all saved.

2,long,"It's a well-known trick if you have been long enough in this space. It's possible that for certain projects (certainly those with unethical people) the ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up all the rare items for cheap

0,space,"1/ We already mentioned earlier that in a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. And they brag about it as well, so we are posting 2 threads that confirm that point. Thread 1:

1,space,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

2,space,"1/ What we will present is all public information, but might still be of interest to some. Just to show that what in the normal world is called ""insider trading"", in the NFT space is called ""Alpha"".

4,space,"@hunconscious Not necessarily earn my place, but I see women not being taken as seriously. Talked over or not given time in Twitter spaces, a lot of mansplaining dms, misgendering etc. I think people overlook the hurdles and barriers in place for many women and gender diverse folks here"
0,founder,"We’re the first NFT project focused on creating diverse leaders. But we’re not stopping there!

Other key roadmap initiatives include:

💸Funding for diverse founders
🤝Mentorship Programmes
🧑🏽‍💻Web3 Onboading &amp; Education
🏳️‍🌈10% of our mint is dedicated to grants for BIPOC + LGBTQ."
1,founder,"Almost every day for two weeks, a new project founder has dm’d me looking for moral support after dealing with intense harassment. We need to cultivate a culture that maintains a certain level of respect for each other as humans - mental health isn’t something you can buy. 1/"
2,founder,"2/2 If founders are serious about their NFT project and have launched it successfully, we are on the opinion that you have to dox yourselves. Why? Because it’s a liability to the project and holders. It will at some point come out and you want to be in control of the narrative."
3,founder,Just heard about the @Blockverse_NFT rug. The project sold out yesterday in less than 8 minutes (500 ETH) and had 792 ETH in secondary sales. Discord &amp; website closed and the anon devs are gone. Do we need a federated entity that approves all NFT projects and its doxxed founders?

1,transparent,"@tothemaxy We've done several giveaways and we always screenshot the transfers. It's important to be transparent - especially in the crypto / NFT world.
Below are examples from two of our winners, who can vouch we're one of the good guys: @Charls020 &amp; @curioso_DR. 💚🦕 https://t.co/uDceOEim0x"
2,transparent,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
3,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
4,transparent,@NateAlexNFT My favourite thing is how it’s not a transparent GIF so when the sun sets and Twitter goes to dark mode I can see the outlines

0,great,"Imagine you are IRL a criminal, crook or conman. And 99% of people know that, so that you can only scam 1%.

And suddenly you hide behind a JPEG, and 99% of people think that you are great, and only 1% knows your shady past.

Some people are laughing all the way to the bank."
1,great,"❓❓❓ What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
✔ NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
2,great,We would greatly appreciate if you could go through all our thousands of spam emails each day and provide proof if they are legit or not. There might be one where someone really wants to send $10M to my bank account and split the difference as a thank you https://t.co/MtP07inymb
3,great,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."
4,great,"If ""influencers"" tell you how great a project is and you don't understand that, please note that they are the experts because they know the founders personally and you are just an ignorant idiot. But if you mint it's your own fault if it goes wrong. WAGMI!

1,community,There’s a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don’t know how I would do this without those people. 💖
2,community,"Have a personal connection with your #NFT! Come mint a PixelSaurus Tri and add up to 3 traits via the same minting site / HODL the feature! 🦕🦖

Only 294 mints remain (out of 1005)!

3,community,"5/ If you are a tolerant community, you still have to be intolerant against intolerance. If you don’t, you allow all kinds of intolerant people to become part of your community and spread their intolerance against you and others."
4,community,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
0,transparency,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don’t mint. It’s quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."
1,transparency,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
2,transparency,Ok so transparency is good. Providing platform to someone to use sexist and ableist slurs ain’t it. Tuning out.

0,project,"We already mentioned earlier that there is a thriving business in selling/buying (verified) Twitter accounts with many followers. It's also very easy to buy (fake) followers to give the impression that there is demand for certain projects.

1,project,"5/ The project has blocked and booted every person that knows what’s going on from their Discord, including @tylengyel, the most active member who owns the trademark to Bored Bunny. The project didn't respond to his C&amp;D letter. https://t.co/eDmAaevesi"
2,project,"14/ If you are part of the inner circle (as a project or as an individual) - it literally even says ""best friends"", then you will certainly be able to benefit from the generosity, altruism and inclusivity of this project. But otherwise you simply have to pay a high price for it. https://t.co/1EQkQt5xP8"
3,project,"1/2 Never get deceived by seemingly good gestures. There is a scammer out there (twitter handle: LurkingisNicer), who rugged the @ElephantNFTS  project and put in his Twitter profile that he donated $50k to charity. He scammer someone recently out of $8000 https://t.co/MeYIAVaGl1 https://t.co/FDKHtPD02b"
4,project,"3/ They are not interested in the content on the NFT project (as exemplified yesterday where MontanaBlack promoted a project that included a Swastika), but only by money/whitelist spots. If they don't get what they want, they start to publicly call legitimate projects a ""scam"". https://t.co/oFDHpM16gv"
0,team,"15/ Another Yuga Labs investor is Diplo (DJ Thomas Wesley Pentz), who recently teamed up with Royal, a venture by Justin Blau (also an investor in Yuga Labs), which recently raised $55 million by a16z. https://t.co/lgq4doqoLb"
1,team,"Two other obvious cash grabs are minting today, PiggyBankers and BigCats for 0.29 and 0.44 ETH respectively. Both with huge Discords, both with ""Marvel artists"" and of course the same anon teams. There is never a justification to ask for 6 to 11 million USD upfront. More later. https://t.co/aHHjuLxtOL"
2,team,4/4 An example is a team member of a project minting tomorrow using a Twitter account from an attorney (who confirmed he was locked out of his account). 99.99% of the 6400 tweets have no relationship with NFTs. Another example is of an actress whose account now has been restored. https://t.co/f4vpRnYEVZ
3,team,"8/ He also claims that they are using a lot of the funds for traveling. They always travel with the whole team (20+ people) together each week, which is a bit ironic for a project that claims to conquer the metaverse. Maybe first invent a metamansion to reduce your expenses."
4,team,16/ We also have confirmation from multiple sources that the @NFT team and the Squiggles team (a team involved in many rugs) exchanged “staff members” (via Luxury Equities by Ali S. and Gavin M.) so it’s all far less innocent and much more connected/orchestrated than it looks.
