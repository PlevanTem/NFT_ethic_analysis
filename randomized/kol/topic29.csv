0,29,roadmap,"2/ No roadmap other than some abstract nonsense, and claiming they are backed by Fortune 500 companies, VCs, investors, traders, but of course there is 0 evidence of that. Claiming they will use the profits for charity as well - we all know that that means. https://t.co/ZqzEhddSYS"

2,29,roadmap,"@OttoSuwenNFT It was indeed a conservative estimation. It could well be even above 95%. These scammers are basically factories that churn out project after project - just mindless JPEGs, without any vision/roadmap. Only fake/corrupt influencers behind them who are willing to promote this stuff"

Check any of the 6000 older tweets. MAYC is mentioned in the founder's profile, but he doesn't own any. There is no roadmap."

1,29,term,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
2,29,term,17/ They will soon become so (financially) powerful and influential that they determine the (ethical) direction of this space. They will become too big to fail in this space.
3,29,term,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."

0,29,transparent,"❓❓❓ What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
✔ NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
1,29,transparent,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
2,29,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
3,29,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
4,29,transparent,"We need a non-profit advertising service that applies some level of due-diligence on the projects it promotes with standardised and transparent fees. 

All profits go to charity. 

I'd work on this for free if people are interested hmu."

0,29,great,"20/ Many influencers &amp; artists don’t care about where the money is coming from or is going (hint: LooksRare). As long as they make money and people buy their art for enormous amounts, they are happy to say how great and beneficial NFTs are. Changing the narrative sometimes helps. https://t.co/GaDdk4UlFs"
1,29,great,"If ""influencers"" tell you how great a project is and you don't understand that, please note that they are the experts because they know the founders personally and you are just an ignorant idiot. But if you mint it's your own fault if it goes wrong. WAGMI!

2,29,great,"6/ In this podcast, one of the founders mentions that they are great because “we always surround ourselves with incredible people” (1:10:10), but if you look at the history of some of the ambassadors, you have to wonder how/why they exactly are selected. https://t.co/qDFyIqDH2c"

2,29,community,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord.

0,29,team,1/ We are going to drop a nuclear bomb on @MetaMansionsNFT and this one is pretty wild. We have heard via a reliable source that the entire team went to Dubai to get UAE citizenship and avoid Canadian income tax. We believe this allegation to be credible. Why?
1,29,team,"15/ Another Yuga Labs investor is Diplo (DJ Thomas Wesley Pentz), who recently teamed up with Royal, a venture by Justin Blau (also an investor in Yuga Labs), which recently raised $55 million by a16z. https://t.co/lgq4doqoLb"
2,29,team,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.

https://t.co/22ZIUxgO4H https://t.co/BFMwANNzx7"
3,29,team,"5/ It would explain why they spent so much money on traveling and also why the whole team had to go there. It also shows bad intent, because if the funds were going to be re-invested, it wouldn't be taxable income. https://t.co/vbGfHbgLUr"

0,29,project,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

2,29,project,"2/ The last weeks we have been mainly warning for scammers/scams (more than 80% of all newly created projects) in order to protect new, young, naive and easily influenced individuals and educate them to spot the red flags themselves."
3,29,project,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk
4,29,project,Of course @hypebearsclub never responded. They count on people that are only active on Instagram and ban anyone who calls them out.
