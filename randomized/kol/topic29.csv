0,29,roadmap,"@OttoSuwenNFT It was indeed a conservative estimation. It could well be even above 95%. These scammers are basically factories that churn out project after project - just mindless JPEGs, without any vision/roadmap. Only fake/corrupt influencers behind them who are willing to promote this stuff"

2,29,roadmap,Dear @Obluda777 - we just noticed that @SadBotsNFT is minting today. On the website you are listed as the co-founder. Who is the other one and why is (s)he not listed? What justifies a mint price of 0.5 (via a DA) for a vague roadmap? Why are there so many 6388 (&gt;70%) WL spots? https://t.co/3UVYJvUEIJ

0,29,term,"2/ We owe a lot to individual Russian people in terms of science, literature, art, music, etc. Bob Dylan’s paternal grandparents emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the US, one of many examples of brilliant minds that originated from Russia."
1,29,term,17/ They will soon become so (financially) powerful and influential that they determine the (ethical) direction of this space. They will become too big to fail in this space.
2,29,term,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don’t mint. It’s quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."

Today he says that ""there was no violation of the terms of services"", but two years ago he was even dropped by his own organization Overtime Gaming.

The founder again comes up with a long-winded story. They talk a lot, but never seem to realize their inconsistencies. https://t.co/pUytDpfgmB"

4,29,long,"20/ Many influencers &amp; artists don’t care about where the money is coming from or is going (hint: LooksRare). As long as they make money and people buy their art for enormous amounts, they are happy to say how great and beneficial NFTs are. Changing the narrative sometimes helps. https://t.co/GaDdk4UlFs"
0,29,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
1,29,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
2,29,transparent,"❓❓❓ What problems does TrustVibes solve? 

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent. 
✔ NFT is a great opportunity, thanks to transparency of blockchain, to record your work in blockchain and get income. https://t.co/9W1GwBla9X"
3,29,transparent,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
4,29,transparent,Good take as usual. The wash trading still rubs me the wrong way but everything was transparent and if this is news to you you didn't DYOR.

If that persists, I'd expect there to be a big nuke in crypto (and NFTs) sooner rather than later. 

For me that'll present a great buying opportunity."

0,29,community,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, “ambassadors”, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot.

4,29,community,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
0,29,transparency,"23/ Scalar Capital is also an investor in Dfinity, which is the former employer of Whizwang (Elizabeth Yang), and Twitter shows that the 2 know each other. Whizwang deleted many tweets (for transparency purposes probably) but did mention that she was part of the zunks team. https://t.co/Hre7maeY1f"
1,29,transparency,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are “dedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication”. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2"
2,29,transparency,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
3,29,transparency,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."

0,29,team,"7/ He furthermore claims that the whole team is working 20 hours a day, that they created something only Google also has (and therefore can't elaborate on that), and that their whole team consists of geniuses. He does not seem to understand how unbelievably unbelievable he sounds"
1,29,team,"If you are new to the NFT space, our advice would be not to mint ANY project for the coming 2 weeks. We have indications that the same scam team created many projects each day, and they only have a limited time window before they are found out. That's why they delay the ""reveal""."
2,29,team,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.

https://t.co/22ZIUxgO4H https://t.co/BFMwANNzx7"
3,29,team,@chriswallace Diverse team though.
4,29,team,"2/ All the team members from MetaMansionsNFT are coming from Canada, but on the KeyLead website Dubai, UAE is clearly mentioned as the key location next to Vancouver, Canada (right-bottom corner). https://t.co/NKMg34spGO"
0,29,project,"It's a well-known trick if you have been long enough in this space. It's possible that for certain projects (certainly those with unethical people) the ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up all the rare items for cheap
https://t.co/8TMBhQn0Ro"
1,29,project,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F
2,29,project,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico’s Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"
3,29,project,"2/ People feel especially betrayed by the fact that only 30 ETH was left in the community fund for further development, while 90 ETH in total seemed to have been paid to some of the moderators. The founders seem to have left the project with more than 1700 ETH."
4,29,project,"In some way it's unnecessary to also mention the project FashionApe, but because it's minting this week and just for the avoidance of doubt - it's all the same scam over and over again (just like MetaTribes) https://t.co/EK5eFypES5 https://t.co/ksZ1fYcH1m"
