We have to overcome the stigma of a charitable cause, understand that it's not only about representation but accessibility &amp; inclusion"

@CozomoMedici I'm raising awareness about maternal mental health and normalising an image of people with disabilities.

0,value,Cultural and social significance of something play huge roles in how we determine value. As does bias. These same concepts apply to digital items in an increasingly digital world.

2,value,"Imagine a scenario of huge consolidation where 1 successful/rich NFT project buys up lots of other promising and undervalued NFT projects and then, after a year, decides to sell it all to Meta/Facebook, Microsoft or any VC. From Web 3.0 to REKT 4.0. Welcome to The Metaverse 19.84"
3,value,"4/ We have thought about some self-regulating mechanisms that will either remove any bad actors completely (and will reduce the value of all their NFT holdings to nearly zero), or ensure they do compensate for their past wrongdoings. How?"
4,value,44/ With an illegal ICO they raised around 2000 Bitcoin (estimated to be between $22 and $34 million dollars) and almost none of the investors saw that money back. The TPAY coin value shows a similar curve as the one from $BGLD. The value dropped from $10.88 USD to $0.05. https://t.co/32If7ANxYr
0,trust,"22/ It‚Äôs interesting to realize that the Web2 world has instilled so much trust into the digital world, that scammers are abusing that trust and people are simply handing over their hard-earned money without any hesitation."
1,trust,6/ Let‚Äôs start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
2,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
3,trust,In @Gfunkera86 we trust üôèüèº
4,trust,"Another big thread about @0xHustler and the project @SavePlanetEarth that is minting later today. It shows once again the dubious ""track records"" that certain people have and how they try to benefit from naive individuals that blindly trust ""charities"".

https://t.co/vZYRumffLc"
0,people,"7/ Only high net worth individuals can use the concierge service, but there is no minimum purchase. So people with a net worth of $50k and willing to spend $25k are declined, but people with a net worth of $10 million that want to spend $10k are accepted? Why? https://t.co/cSVzKGunXE"
1,people,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
2,people,"It's a well-known trick if you have been long enough in this space. It's possible that for certain projects (certainly those with unethical people) the ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up all the rare items for cheap

1,community,"6/ It shows that new incentive-based contracts are required. An example could be that 10% of all the mint money goes to the project founders, and 90% to a community wallet. Only after a milestone on the roadmap is met, a percentage of the money will be paid out to the founders."
2,community,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You‚Äôre right, we‚Äôre all learning. It‚Äôs good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it‚Äôs almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn‚Äôt established."
3,community,"9/ Any new projects that will be created will have to have the wallets and TRUSTH score of their founders listed, and if the founders ‚Äúrug‚Äù the project, either they will see their TRUSTH score getting very low or they can refund/compensate the community."
4,community,"28/ Even though Beanie always mentions ‚Äúcommunity first‚Äù, none of the 7.5% OS royalties on Monkey Bet, Baboon Bet or Pit Boss went to the DAO members or was invested in any way in the project at all."

We meant to say: don't mint this stuff. They are not on LinkedIn.

If you don't get obvious irony, how can you see through not so obvious scams?
