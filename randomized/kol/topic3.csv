0,3,dao,@pixelbot24 Fair point. :) These are actual real names of NFT collections. And we do have all the names of the people behind these rugs.

2,3,dao,"Adding to this, collections that provide a diverse spectrum of gender representation within their traits will also do well. The future of this space is inclusive and diverse, the real world isn‚Äôt 75% men but people of all genders."

We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.

3,3,space,"7/ This space consists of many (com)passionate communities, creative creators, committed contributors, compulsive collectors, combined with colossal quantities of crypto capital, and as such is and remains a force to be reckoned with."
4,3,space,5/ You never heard of the FlamingoDAO? It's an exclusive group of 100 wealthy people that invest together in all kinds of NFT projects. There are quite a lot of these DAOs - they are some sort of mini VCs within the NFT space. https://t.co/eldIPvFUVr
0,3,trust,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"

1,3,people,4/ We noticed you were posing in quite a fancy car. Can you explain why so many of those people in Dubai that are currently on our NFT radar are driving a Lambos?

1,3,better,"3/ Some claim that this is especially disturbing since a @GalacticApesNFT genesis holder recently offered 200 ETH to buy the project, while it now seems to have been ‚Äúhanded‚Äù over for free. No (proper) explanation has been provided as to why they thought this is a better option."
2,3,better,"We wonder when Sam Bankman-Fried is going to change the last 2 vowels in his surname with 2 other ones that better reflect his MO. The fact that he dresses the way he does is probably a subtle reference to Andersen‚Äôs fairytale ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".

3,3,better,@NFTherder We now receive 200 DM's per day with projects that we never heard of. Most of them all use the same playbook. We can't check each of the 100's of projects that are coming out each day and wanted to give people a general harsh warning. Sometimes it's better to be safe than sorry.
