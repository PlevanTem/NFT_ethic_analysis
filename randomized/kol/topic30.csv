4,30,account,"Yes, @MutantXApe (minting today) is a scam. Undoxxed team, empty roadmap, Twitter account with 24k followers in 1 month, closed Discord with 100k members, and their AMA on YouTube was also made private. Apparently they used actors to feature in that AMA.

1,30,scam,"Normally scam projects gain in 2 major ways. First via all the mint money (and royalties), but secondly because the scammers sell off all their free/cheap NFTs they got from the WL sale off on OS during the initial hype for a lot of money. We are breaking that business model."
2,30,scam,"2/ The last weeks we have been mainly warning for scammers/scams (more than 80% of all newly created projects) in order to protect new, young, naive and easily influenced individuals and educate them to spot the red flags themselves."
3,30,scam,"17/ That is of course not the case – these founders that earn tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars with all these scam mints want to remain anonymous for obvious reasons. And they have sufficient funds to make that possible."

0,30,trust,6/ Let’s start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how “trustworthy” each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
1,30,trust,"Why scammers &amp; fraudsters thrive? Research shows that people tend to default to trusting others over distrusting them, believing them over doubting them and going along with someone’s self-presentation rather than embarrassing them by calling them out. https://t.co/KAu7BQh7JG"
2,30,trust,"5. That analogy can be transposed to NFTs. If punks or apes go lower, I'm fine holding and actually likely to buy more. I trust the devs. When XYZ pump project goes lower in a bear mkt I'm literally fucked, because I probably won't even be able to sell it and it'll feel rly shit."
3,30,trust,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
4,30,trust,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
