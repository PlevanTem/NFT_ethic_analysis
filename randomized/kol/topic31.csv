https://t.co/CTu9CMJ6DJ https://t.co/IAOStj0Ega"
2,31,ask,"8/ We asked Moonpay and its CEO many questions on 28 January 2021 and had an additional observation a couple of days later. Since 28 January, the CEO has not been on Twitter anymore and never responded. https://t.co/XWmcNoAo2I"

4,31,ask,"1/ Someone shared a screenshot of @MetaMansionsNFT’s response to our thread about them. We would like to ask them to show/share all the proof that they have about our interaction with them. Of course there is none, but it’s always interesting to see what they come up with. https://t.co/oAATMXRdq4"
0,31,let,"Funny to see that the same person who promoted HypeBears is apparently also promoting CerealClub. He has now deleted the tweet, but it can still be found via the WayBack machine.

1,31,let,"There are 2 nightmare scenarios:

1. The foundations of the Metaverse are built by and for charlatans (possibly the current scenario)

2. The Metaverse is completely regulated by AI algorithms in an Orwellian way (possibly a future scenario)

Finding a middle way will be the key."

3,31,let,"1/ CerealClub that is minting today is a scam. Associated with Squiggles and having a mint price of 0.5 (via a Dutch auction going to 0.1), which worst case would net the project &gt;$11 million USD. Team is completely anonymous and https://t.co/AHW8mTkmwV"
4,31,let,"7/ One of these scams is @MissUniverseNFt and it was not mentioned on the overview in the orginal thread. This was a project that @NFT heavily promoted, even with AMA’s with the “founder”, but it was a rug and the website of the Miss Universe has been deleted. https://t.co/uFbwMfDy3w"
0,31,question,"10/ We questioned the ponzinomics of LooksRare, the anonymous founders, the tens of millions that were TornadoCash’ed, and the incestuous advisors and investors who defended wash trading. https://t.co/E6XlEu0QmW"
1,31,question,"We received DMs from more than 10 people that @crocodood minting later today is a complete scam. We generally call out projects with high mint prices, but the DMs were so extensive (OGs &amp; mod team were banned for asking questions), that we have to share it
https://t.co/ZUFHNHpBlc https://t.co/r4PZKj5ePK"
2,31,question,"@diverse @023 We have asked some legitimate questions and leave it up to others to judge whether they find your answers satisfactory. We have more info about the other founder (who also lost his IG verification) and his GF, and about your dev Praj that was associated with the banned @NFT IG. https://t.co/flasygWtMY"
3,31,question,"So we just asked an innocent but legitimate question to @aatwts and we received a lot of criticism, but now understand why. He asked his followers to spam us, and even asks people to lie that we blocked people. Amazing.

We have never ever blocked anyone.

https://t.co/94vmeqRejI https://t.co/L4CsleY929"
4,31,question,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as “learning experiences”) and trust the process (don’t ask any questions, but “trust us”). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN"
0,31,think,"65/ We still have far and far more information that we have not (yet) disclosed, but we think we have presented enough evidence to allow people to make up their own judgement as to the kind of person that Beanie (really) is."
1,31,think,"9/ Do you think it is appropriate for you, as the CEO of MoonPay, to personally trade in NFTs, when you have insider information about (celebrity) deals that can have a material impact on the value of that NFT? https://t.co/ih6dgOCk7b"
2,31,think,"@NFTethics @moonbirds_xyz I’m gutted because when you first came into the scene you wrote good shit and it was a real prevention mechanism for future scammers. 

Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It’s a shame really."
3,31,think,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"
4,31,think,"11/ And talking about ""diversity"": did you know that @friendswithyou both seems to think that BAYC is racist, but also has been accused of racism themselves? Well, the below attachments show just that. Life is ironic sometimes. https://t.co/CAVDiPPQcV"
0,31,need,"5/ As we already explained before, you need to have a proper justification to dox someone. Twitter does allow it when you use publicly available information and they allow you to mention someone’s name and quite a lot of other information as well – see the exhaustive list below. https://t.co/aaax2UdJyD"
1,31,need,"@CoachP1421 @MetaKryptVault Just to let you know that we have also been blocked by this person, even though we had never heard of this account before (and never reported about them). Maybe Twitter needs to consider adding an option that shows by which persons we have all been blocked (for transparency). https://t.co/SHJPIonToy"

1,31,sure,"20/ Exposing Beanie was financially the worst decision that we could have personally made, but we did it and didn’t sell any NFTs before his exposure. We also never benefited from trading in NFTs in any way by using this account and the blockchain will provide that."
2,31,sure,"@ethcapitalmaxi Most of the tweets were written out, but you always have to change a couple of things to make sure it fits Twitter's character limitation. The other time-consuming task is adding around 100 attachments (it's on average 4 per post)."
3,31,sure,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.

0,31,know,"It’s super depressing to see women only taking place on lists meant to ‘uplift women in NFTs’ and rarely if ever featured on lists JUST through merit of their work. Acknowledge women for their brilliance in all instances, not just for diversity clout/engagement."
1,31,know,"12/ Years ago this was already very well known, but of course no action was ever taken. Everyone benefited was the short-term view, but it ultimately also eroded people’s appetite to pay taxes and their sense of justice. And dirty money and venture capital became more entangled. https://t.co/3HnaloWyJw"
2,31,know,"If ""influencers"" tell you how great a project is and you don't understand that, please note that they are the experts because they know the founders personally and you are just an ignorant idiot. But if you mint it's your own fault if it goes wrong. WAGMI!

3,31,know,"3/ This is not the best way of using our time. Many scammers, fraudsters, thieves and criminals IRL are behaving in the same in the digital world, so it only confirms what most will already know. There are also too many to report about."

0,31,make,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."

We didn’t trust this right away due to the murkiness of the entire situation."
4,31,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
