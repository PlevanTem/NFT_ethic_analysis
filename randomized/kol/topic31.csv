0,think,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
1,think,"65/ We still have far and far more information that we have not (yet) disclosed, but we think we have presented enough evidence to allow people to make up their own judgement as to the kind of person that Beanie (really) is."
2,think,"@arvinlolme @NFTherder Yes, in the thread he mentions that 3 months ago he made you aware of this and that nothing has been done yet. A bit more pro-activity wouldn't hurt don't you think? Certainly given the small investment it requires and the huge amount of primary/secondary sales in comparison."
3,think,"2/ That project is also minting today. All these individuals generally DM us on mint day or the day before to warn us that they think the project is a scam given their extensive experiences in the Discord. It remains very difficult to check if that is always the case, because..."
4,think,"20/ But this will require further evaluation as “truth” is a social construct that is (more) difficult to algorithmize. Some think that certain “truths” are misinformation that should be censored, while others think it’s wrong to censor “truths” by calling it misinformation."
0,king,"12/ The last entry of his blog was on 14 April 2020, and up until that point he always mentioned his girlfriend M., but when looking deeper at properties that were purchased after April 2020, we noticed that another name came up: Gabriella Falcon. https://t.co/ouf4A1hN9R"
1,king,@Vince_Van_Dough @NFTethics @DeezeFi Can confirm I was also with Deeze last night and I got high just by looking him in the eye.
2,king,"3/ The Discord automatically censors anyone that mentions your real name and you also proactively ban people with critical questions. Both censoring and blocking people is not part of the true spirit of Web3, so why are you trying to become active in this space? https://t.co/fsTPtee47H"
3,king,"23/Imagine being a billionaire and trying to rip off poor teenagers by deceiving them into buying worthless JPEGs with their only/small savings? And not taking any responsibility for it, not feeling even ashamed of it, but going on stage and pretending to be a reputable NFT guru. https://t.co/KoeIWqrdrk"
4,king,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico’s Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"

2,list,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2"

2,fee,"3/ Nima often posts about Dubai on IG, but the most important evidence is from another co-founder, who is still very young and he mentioned on Twitter last month “Living in Dubai feels like living in the Metaverse”.

Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It’s a shame really."
4,fee,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"
0,gas,"The project @DeluxeGoat is 99.9% a scam (also minting today). Founders have 0 and 1 post on IG.

0,trust,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."

3,trust,"20/ And he mentions that people especially trusted @NFT because of Mark Cuban’s name on the page and the blue verified account. They tried to remove his name after this scandal came out, but the screenshots were already taken. https://t.co/r1aX2fNcf9"
4,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
