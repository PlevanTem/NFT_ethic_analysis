0,look,7/ We have tried to look into the BAYC founders‚Äô histories (or whatever is available on the Internet and that‚Äôs not much) to see if it‚Äôs possible to understand what their real intentions were and to compare it with what they have told publicly.
1,look,"We thought that the irony was obvious, but around 50% of the people didn't get it looking at the comments.

We meant to say: don't mint this stuff. They are not on LinkedIn.

If you don't get obvious irony, how can you see through not so obvious scams?

2,look,"13/ @jf_nft mentions that he provides ‚Äúfacts‚Äù with that pathetic chart that will only convince people with very low 2 digit IQs. The chart will certainly already look different now, and even more so in the future. Who are the ""competitors"" and how did you calculate their score? https://t.co/g9Xb8vw6jQ"
3,look,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."
4,look,"@PastelPersons @garyvee @elldeeNFT Agreed! Just look how much effort has gone into this NFT! All Gary's favourite things! I can personally vouch for Pastel Persons; a truly beautiful, ethical project with some of the best women in the NFT space. üíöü¶ïü¶ñ"

4,use,"4/ They use the influence that they have as leverage to get what they want. If you don't agree they will use their influence to make sure your project doesn't succeed. When Ayroeth sold his Bored Ape, he continued to use it, until he was called out. His bio still mentions BAYC. https://t.co/gQ0Z0RQuer"
0,feel,"2/ People feel especially betrayed by the fact that only 30 ETH was left in the community fund for further development, while 90 ETH in total seemed to have been paid to some of the moderators. The founders seem to have left the project with more than 1700 ETH."
1,feel,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You‚Äôre right, we‚Äôre all learning. It‚Äôs good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it‚Äôs almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn‚Äôt established."
2,feel,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because ‚Äúthere's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn‚Äôt think that that would also apply to the ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"
3,feel,"3/ Nima often posts about Dubai on IG, but the most important evidence is from another co-founder, who is still very young and he mentioned on Twitter last month ‚ÄúLiving in Dubai feels like living in the Metaverse‚Äù. The post was liked by his mother and other co-founders. https://t.co/YnSfJnre3N"

We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
0,project,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.

https://t.co/HjnfLA5kY0 https://t.co/4dPqEIIWop"
1,project,"Of course @DoodlesCatsNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community, no website, nothing. When you have (serious) doubts about a project, avoid. https://t.co/ffwvprkZ9u"
2,project,"2/ That project is also minting today. All these individuals generally DM us on mint day or the day before to warn us that they think the project is a scam given their extensive experiences in the Discord. It remains very difficult to check if that is always the case, because..."
3,project,"4/ The reason for sending this out now, is that tomorrow Bored Mutant Bunny is minting, created by the same group. We want to warn people not to mint that project. https://t.co/AAgwZDtaVe"
4,project,"Glad to see increasingly more research being done into new and suspiciously looking projects such as @koonimalsnft. The web of social media influencers responsible for (promoting) many of these projects will gradually be unraveled.

Credit to @fauxcondor.

0,case,"43/ One of the largest and most prominent crypto scams he has been involved in is the case of TokenPay (TPAY), whereby he pretended again to be an investor, but really was suspected to be acting as the CEO behind the screens. He wrote the WP foreword, see: https://t.co/Oe2utTitIz"
1,case,"3/ Cohen's company S.A.C. Capital Advisors (named after his initials) ""pleaded guilty to insider trading and agreed to pay $1.8 billion in fines ($900 million in forfeiture and $900 million in fines) in one of the biggest criminal cases against a hedge fund"". https://t.co/wIfPjTCThu"
2,case,Dear Amir (@mondoir) - a quick reminder to let you know that your company accounts are overdue. Just letting you know in case you don't have an accountant or they were not able to contact you. Always happy to help. https://t.co/g5lCAxKnNi
3,case,9/ Indicating possible criminal acts and/or fraud prevention constitute a legitimate interest or should be regarded as a legitimate interest to dox someone and we believe that is the case for this particular individual as this thread will show.

3,grab,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don‚Äôt mint. It‚Äôs quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."
4,grab,"We simply have to all agree that we don‚Äôt mint any project with mint prices &gt;0.1 (ideally lower). It will disincentive scammers to go for cash grabs, will keep more liquidity in the NFT/ETH ecosystem and will create more innovation in this space (e.g. performance-based contracts)"
0,maybe,9/ We have provided some background info on 888. He has also not been active on Twitter anymore. Maybe he travelled to Thailand to buy himself a(nother) wife or maybe he is busy asking Harvey Weinstein for legal advice. https://t.co/4mDbTTpB4v
1,maybe,"Three months ago @nesotual was a co-founder of @gemxyz (see video at 6:28: https://t.co/UVZ8pu4d4F), but after the sexual misconduct allegations, @LorensHuculak mentioned he was a anon developer &amp; team member. Next time maybe also check out what other ENS profiles he registered. https://t.co/kwS6BwWXSb"
2,maybe,"Publishing the below thread on April Fool‚Äôs Day would have been a bit too obvious, so we decided to do it one month earlier. We appreciated all the comments and maybe you might understand the irony at some point. 
We laughed (and learned) a lot. Thank you.
https://t.co/cbkLeE9oqm"
3,maybe,"1/ We have a couple of quick observations about the project @theshifters_ (90k Discord members), which will soon start minting. We were informed by multiple persons that tried to ask some questions that they were banned/blocked, so maybe it helps if we clarify their position."
4,maybe,"25/ Referring to Solano‚Äôs own words below, maybe BAYC is the ultimate crypto hack by some guys that are laughing all the way to the bank having deceived the VCs and their holders in a cryptographic way that aligns with the true nature of cryptography itself. https://t.co/ehDOA1fm2c"
0,trust,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
1,trust,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.
