2,32,think,"23/ We do think that it is problematic when we don‚Äôt know the ulterior ideology/intentions of the founders, certainly when so much money is involved and all these opportunistic VCs and celebrities are blindly aping into this project. More clarity should be provided."
3,32,think,"16/ Since people have become more hesitant about projects with non-doxxed founders, these scam rings now often pay ‚Äúpuppets‚Äù that pretend that they are the ‚Äúfounders‚Äù, so that naive people think that the founders are actually doxed."
4,32,think,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk

0,32,case,9/ Indicating possible criminal acts and/or fraud prevention constitute a legitimate interest or should be regarded as a legitimate interest to dox someone and we believe that is the case for this particular individual as this thread will show.
1,32,case,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let‚Äôs hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don‚Äôt have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else. You might want to review some of your past digital tracks to make that not too easy...
2,32,case,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name.

4,32,case,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
0,32,use,"54/ The domain name for Huntingdon Investment was only registered just before the ICO launch, so it only seems to be used to provide credibility to the claim that Beanie was only an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù instead of the mastermind behind it. The domain is currently available to register... https://t.co/jpNxPFGcat"

Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it‚Äôs almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn‚Äôt established."
1,32,trust,"‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.
