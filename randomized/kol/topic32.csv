1,32,think,"65/ We still have far and far more information that we have not (yet) disclosed, but we think we have presented enough evidence to allow people to make up their own judgement as to the kind of person that Beanie (really) is."
2,32,think,"23/ We do think that it is problematic when we don’t know the ulterior ideology/intentions of the founders, certainly when so much money is involved and all these opportunistic VCs and celebrities are blindly aping into this project. More clarity should be provided."
3,32,think,"16/ Since people have become more hesitant about projects with non-doxxed founders, these scam rings now often pay “puppets” that pretend that they are the “founders”, so that naive people think that the founders are actually doxed."
4,32,think,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk

A project called @ApeDoods is minting today (total scam with fake/corrupt influencers) and many others are minting soon. Identify the obvious scams and cash grabs.

0,32,case,9/ Indicating possible criminal acts and/or fraud prevention constitute a legitimate interest or should be regarded as a legitimate interest to dox someone and we believe that is the case for this particular individual as this thread will show.
1,32,case,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let’s hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don’t have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else. You might want to review some of your past digital tracks to make that not too easy...
2,32,case,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name. It is obvious in whose possession those valuable domain names are or were in case they have been resold. The domains were listed on https://t.co/bpvWhH592q. https://t.co/dUgpCIuQqk"

4,32,case,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
0,32,use,"54/ The domain name for Huntingdon Investment was only registered just before the ICO launch, so it only seems to be used to provide credibility to the claim that Beanie was only an “investor” instead of the mastermind behind it. The domain is currently available to register... https://t.co/jpNxPFGcat"

1,32,need,"@CoachP1421 @MetaKryptVault Just to let you know that we have also been blocked by this person, even though we had never heard of this account before (and never reported about them).

0,32,trust,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."
1,32,trust,"❓❓❓ How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.

We didn’t trust this right away due to the murkiness of the entire situation."

4,32,trust,"Why scammers &amp; fraudsters thrive? Research shows that people tend to default to trusting others over distrusting them, believing them over doubting them and going along with someone’s self-presentation rather than embarrassing them by calling them out. https://t.co/KAu7BQh7JG"

1,32,like,"3/ Nima often posts about Dubai on IG, but the most important evidence is from another co-founder, who is still very young and he mentioned on Twitter last month “Living in Dubai feels like living in the Metaverse”. The post was liked by his mother and other co-founders. https://t.co/YnSfJnre3N"
2,32,like,1/ Later today @mcuban is one of the speakers on the NFTLA event and this is a reminder that 'his' @NFT page was responsible for many scams/rugs and many new people wanting to join the NFT space will likely have left the ecosystem because of this. https://t.co/YxyDhETQXb
3,32,like,"Many prominent people active in the NFT space who frequently say “WAGMI” and “Care for the community”, really mean: we need everyone to believe this so that they fill up the liquidity pool that I want to drain. 

They claim to like decentralization, but only for selfish purposes."
4,32,like,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
0,32,issue,"Many people that are socially or financially invested in a project or person, seem to turn a blind eye to any ethical issues regarding that project or person. They measure morality in dollars or degree of loyalty/friendship. In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
