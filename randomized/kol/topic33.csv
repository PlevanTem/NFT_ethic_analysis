0,33,gender,Reminder that trans people exist and all kinds of voices are attached to all kinds of people. The idea of a ‘female voice’ is very much a transphobic one and I’m sure contributes to a lack of gender diverse voices in places like Twitter spaces.
1,33,gender,Women and gender diverse folks as the main post instead of the after-thought comment thread. Ty for coming to my TED talk.
2,33,gender,"We met SO many new frens today who share our vision of a diversified &amp; inclusive web3. 🌈✊🏽

So as a little treat… here’s a sneak peak of one of our small but mighty ChangeMakers. 

3333 gender diverse, authentic &amp; joyful peeps coming soon👩🏾‍🎤💫

3,33,gender,I have just applied to be 1 of 33 council members for @rugradio RugDAO - diversity of voice is important and I would love to see more women and gender diverse folks apply. Applications close (Thursday) 11:59PM EST. 👇https://t.co/mG26d9eVZu
4,33,gender,I’d love to know who your favourite women and gender diverse artists are ✨
0,33,win,"3/ They are often influencers with large followings: Farokh, Deeze, Ohhshiny (who blocked us - more about that next week when we discuss all the billionaires active in the NFT space), and they did lots of interviews with all of them. https://t.co/XcXCA7Wwcb"
1,33,win,"🚀 💗 Ive teamed up with @CryptoNeonGirls for a collaboration that’s out of this world!👽

2,33,win,"1/ We already mentioned earlier that in a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. And they brag about it as well, so we are posting 2 threads that confirm that point. Thread 1:
https://t.co/YDv2nsofEj"
3,33,win,"1. OG crypto and NFT people are paranoid about future ""winters"". This is a cognitive bias; the ""curse of knowledge"". What's different now compared to 2018 is mass adoption, proven concepts, technology and utility. We're not getting another crypto winter."
4,33,win,1/ In the past hours we received messages from more than 10 individuals who mentioned that Yubico from CerealClub is a (serial) rugger. We reviewed the evidence and found the allegations credible. We will provide the evidence in the following tweets. https://t.co/SHnEYkjKlw
0,33,tag,"10/ Let’s get on with the Yuga Labs investors again. Brian Cho, former partner of a16z (surprise 1) who created the early-stage venture firm Patron, backed by a16z (surprise 2) including one partner, who used to work at Riot Games, where the 2 Patron founders worked (surprise 3). https://t.co/kvbTqrBL7G"
1,33,tag,"FREE 👀 #MetaRebels #NFT Mint for existing #TrustVibes DAO Holders will be happening on May 26th - June 9th 2022 🎉

All the information regarding our 3 Stage #Ethereum Mint, can be found in @JustinWBratton Announcement 👇 $TRUST https://t.co/nxaKrgOnzf"
2,33,tag,"6/ It shows that new incentive-based contracts are required. An example could be that 10% of all the mint money goes to the project founders, and 90% to a community wallet. Only after a milestone on the roadmap is met, a percentage of the money will be paid out to the founders."
3,33,tag,"The NFT space basically consists of two worlds: 

1. Experienced investors that use Twitter/reputable contacts for their info. 
2. Inexperienced naifs that get their info from paid shills at Instagram.

They never talk about or even mention the same projects."
4,33,tag,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.

https://t.co/asFIFOFxSl https://t.co/HODRXFpgTt"
0,33,retweet,"For all the thousands of people that like, retweet and follow all the NFT projects that TheJenus promotes, we here share you the rates that that they charge. Zero effort, zero accountability - only interested in $.

We talked about perverse incentives in the NFT space before... https://t.co/o9NvLZ40BO"
1,33,retweet,"Just a quick retweet from the same group that created the Squiggles document. They also claim that @YogiesNFT that is minting in a couple of hours is a project/rug by the Squiggles team and have compiled a 171 document with proof/evidence.

https://t.co/oxPgixQoCQ"
2,33,retweet,"For those who want to listed back to the story of the founding artist of @WeatheReportNFT.

Zach promised WL spots for those that unfollowed the artist @Dentinmyhead and who retweeted/confirmed the version of the truth that they wanted to come out.

0,33,like,We would advise people to check your timeline and avoid any project that you are promoting. Because it's 99.9% likely that you are associated with the same organization that is creating all these scams and that also perfectly explains your response to us. https://t.co/W7crKYeVIg https://t.co/2Y8iBBGfPL
1,33,like,23/ Digital ethics will likely become one of the foundations and cornerstones of Web3 and the Metaverse and as such cannot be underestimated. We are all individually responsible for the digital world that we together create.
2,33,like,I would like the donation to go to @Mermaids_Gender - an organisation that does incredible work supporting trans and gender diverse youth and their families. Thank you @alienfrens 💖
3,33,like,"It looks like the SEC's experience with @ElonMusk, the owner of the first NFT Company or Company NFT that was shilled on Twitter, will likely serve as a blueprint for the future regulation of NFTs. More background here: https://t.co/KU17A6PENE"
4,33,like,@NFTethics @farokh @RugRadio @greatmando_nft @belikewater893 @pranksy I also stated I invested here 👍:
0,33,woman,"“For most of history, Anonymous was a woman” - Virginia Woolf. For many of us, some anonymity provides safety in spaces that are typically hostile or imbalanced. It’s sad that this is then used to appropriate diversity for gain."

2,33,woman,"Gender doesn’t define our project - our work speaks for itself, but I do want to make it clear that the ‘woman led project’ tag isn’t a glossy sticker used to sell diversity. It’s just who we are. 3/"

Disability inclusion is equally important as gender &amp; racial equity, diversity and inclusion! If you think otherwise, you are the part of the problem.

1,33,equality,"@Chodan_Bakri Respectfully, I disagree. A huge amount of incredible work doesn’t do well because of implicit bias and the unequal representation of genders within the space. Until we reach that equality, more effort needs to be put into amplifying underrepresented groups."
2,33,equality,"How can we ensure #web3 doesn't repeat the inequality of the past/ present?

✊🏽Authentic representation.

🎓Educating &amp; onboarding people from underrepresented groups.

🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️More diverse leaders in positions of power.

🤝Accessible communities built by the people for ALL people."

4,33,equality,@Ape7068 @psych_nft You would prefer me to ask women not to reduce men to their marital status to be fair despite it not being a thing? Assuming equality doesn’t make it so. Men’s accomplishments are never eclipsed by their marital status.
