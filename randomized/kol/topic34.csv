We’d love to shoutout our friends @MMonstersClub - focusing on accessibility, mental health &amp; inclusion. 

And @ohnahji - leaders of DEI, minting at just 0.01 to help onboard more diverse folks into NFTs!"

We're not only providing great #Metaverse and IRL utilities but work on building #equitable and #inclusive #Web3 🚀

Let's normalise having real/fictional influencers &amp; role models w/ #disabilities. There's no #equity without #disabilityinclusion 💜 https://t.co/KLrA0VeEIa"

3,34,inclusion,"GM #NFTCommunity!
Disability visibility &amp; inclusion for 1.85B of people is an integral part of the equity, diversity &amp; inclusion agenda. It can bring effective changes and universal innovation in Web3, Metaverse and NFT!

1,34,style,It was a brilliant strategy from Yuga Labs. Let all the poor souls sell off their NFTs from other projects so that they could purchase (305) ApeCoin at the top and then create a “high gas” minting process which only the “rich &amp; influential” could afford. Win-win in true VC style.

1,34,history,"6/ In this podcast, one of the founders mentions that they are great because “we always surround ourselves with incredible people” (1:10:10), but if you look at the history of some of the ambassadors, you have to wonder how/why they exactly are selected. https://t.co/qDFyIqDH2c"
2,34,history,"21/ When typing in the real name of Owlman into OS, an ENS domain showed up attached to an account (0x08ac0605d7dca266735e9686dd90285b9e4952f0) with an interesting history. It was the deployer of CBET, a “scam token”, associated with a variety of “scam projects”, incl. TokenPay. https://t.co/HD29IBYdHe"
3,34,history,"7/ One guy went from $100M to bankruptcy, another one spent some time in jail for not paying his ex-wife the divorce settlement, while yet another one has a history of sexual misconduct. And another one has a private Twitter profile where he seems to be shirtless (no idea why?) https://t.co/e6t26AFxvj"

0,34,work,"When people say they love decentralization, it's often because they are part of a centralized narrative from a centralized network that requires you to exchange your currently ""centralized"" FIAT money to crypto, so that they can (ab)use that in a ""centralized"" way. The irony."

0,34,culture,"There's a fine line between condemning cancel culture and cultural insensitivity. 

If you are someone who hasn't personally suffered discrimination in your life, then who are you to judge? 

I'm all for freedom of beliefs but branding everything as cancel culture is not right."
