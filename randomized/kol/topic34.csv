If you are someone who hasn't personally suffered discrimination in your life, then who are you to judge? 

I'm all for freedom of beliefs but branding everything as cancel culture is not right."

1,face,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."

0,style,It was a brilliant strategy from Yuga Labs. Let all the poor souls sell off their NFTs from other projects so that they could purchase (305) ApeCoin at the top and then create a “high gas” minting process which only the “rich &amp; influential” could afford. Win-win in true VC style.
