1,like,There is an unconfirmed rumor that Facebook is about to acquire @TheSandboxGame. It looks like regulation is coming sooner than later to this space... https://t.co/XiAelDoBac
2,like,Reminder that trans people exist and all kinds of voices are attached to all kinds of people. The idea of a ‚Äòfemale voice‚Äô is very much a transphobic one and I‚Äôm sure contributes to a lack of gender diverse voices in places like Twitter spaces.
3,like,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

4,like,@realhumankinder Positive: probably ethical visibility for industries like clothing and their supply chains. A restructuring of power dynamics and wealth. Negative: maybe the decentralised nature allows easy funding for terrible things?
0,profit,"2/ No roadmap other than some abstract nonsense, and claiming they are backed by Fortune 500 companies, VCs, investors, traders, but of course there is 0 evidence of that. Claiming they will use the profits for charity as well - we all know that that means. https://t.co/ZqzEhddSYS"
1,profit,"15/ Indeed, a16z's Marc Andreessen &amp; Chris Dixon personally, but also the 2 co-founders of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, who after that started his own VC Paradigm, and became an advisor to 0x Labs. 0x Labs is a non profit org, but raised $70m from Coinbase &amp; Co. https://t.co/BGz3SOC5u7"

Website &amp; Twitter deleted, so that the large Twitter accounts that were involved in this scam don't have the evidence anymore on their timeline. https://t.co/WBNN9G8Zr8"

Two days ago Jared Kushner received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia for his new VC. His brother is an investor in @yugalabs.

0,market,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"
1,market,"2/ He bought a lot of NFTs at the top and when the market went down, he was allegedly $10 million under water. He manufactured a fake argument with Nifty Gateway (see article) and he then got into DMs with all artists he bought from https://t.co/WH48ZmfIBN"

4,market,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2"
0,person,"22/ Transparency pervades all domains and each person will be asked to provide certain basic input such as your wallet addresses, disclosures about (financial) relationships with (past/future) projects, alpha groups and/or other influencers (and their wallets)."
1,person,"5/ The project has blocked and booted every person that knows what‚Äôs going on from their Discord, including @tylengyel, the most active member who owns the trademark to Bored Bunny. The project didn't respond to his C&amp;D letter. https://t.co/eDmAaevesi"
2,person,"2/ The person in question is MontanaBlack with 1.1M Twitter followers. He basically says he didn't know it was a scam, and couldn't believe it was because it was so ""hyped"". He was happy that others pointed out it was a scam before everything sold out. And DYOR of course!"
3,person,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility ü§ùüíñ"
4,person,"@CoachP1421 @MetaKryptVault Just to let you know that we have also been blocked by this person, even though we had never heard of this account before (and never reported about them). Maybe Twitter needs to consider adding an option that shows by which persons we have all been blocked (for transparency). https://t.co/SHJPIonToy"
0,sell,"9/ We have received confirmation from multiple independent sources that Marc Cuban's @NFT venture offered equity to projects that had the potential to sell out. That would also explain why they received so much money from certain projects and why they did so much ""due diligence"". https://t.co/zlFX9mwfXM"
1,sell,"@BoredApe1000 @larvalabs The morality of the situation is exactly what I am questioning. Why would you sell something that you created and intend on deeming worthless? It's no different to selling a lemon. 

They should have just burnt them."
2,sell,"20/ Exposing Beanie was financially the worst decision that we could have personally made, but we did it and didn‚Äôt sell any NFTs before his exposure. We also never benefited from trading in NFTs in any way by using this account and the blockchain will provide that."

0,buy,"8/ We see a lot of messages about inclusive, but when you start a Dutch Auction at 3.33 ETH (those who buy early will be able to snap up the rare traits), you are favoring the rich and are not really ""inclusive"". https://t.co/0Y1pnt7bxZ"

2,buy,"2/ They would either reach out to celebrities or celebrities would contact them, so if you have been rugged, know that @jf_nft/@0xAA_NFT were responsible. They allegedly told insiders not to buy what they posted at @NFT IG because they knew they were rugs.
