0,roadmap,"We’re the first NFT project focused on creating diverse leaders. But we’re not stopping there!

Other key roadmap initiatives include:

💸Funding for diverse founders
🤝Mentorship Programmes
🧑🏽‍💻Web3 Onboading &amp; Education
🏳️‍🌈10% of our mint is dedicated to grants for BIPOC + LGBTQ."
1,roadmap,"6/ It shows that new incentive-based contracts are required. An example could be that 10% of all the mint money goes to the project founders, and 90% to a community wallet. Only after a milestone on the roadmap is met, a percentage of the money will be paid out to the founders."
2,roadmap,Dear @Obluda777 - we just noticed that @SadBotsNFT is minting today. On the website you are listed as the co-founder. Who is the other one and why is (s)he not listed? What justifies a mint price of 0.5 (via a DA) for a vague roadmap? Why are there so many 6388 (&gt;70%) WL spots? https://t.co/3UVYJvUEIJ
3,roadmap,"If you’re looking for an #NFT project that has diversity, inclusivity &amp; equality at its heart, come grab yourself a PixelSaurus! We have over 500+ designs, a cool roadmap and are also verified on @opensea. #NFTs

4,roadmap,"2/ No roadmap other than some abstract nonsense, and claiming they are backed by Fortune 500 companies, VCs, investors, traders, but of course there is 0 evidence of that. Claiming they will use the profits for charity as well - we all know that that means. https://t.co/ZqzEhddSYS"
0,doxxed,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility 🤝💖"
1,doxxed,"Not everyone that is not doxxed has something to hide, but those that have something to hide are generally always not doxxed.

Not everyone that is anonymous is a scammer, but scammers are generally always anonymous.

""Bad"" people always use ""exceptions"" to justify their behavior"
2,doxxed,"We ""doxxed"" many ""anon"" influencers in the NFT space. It was often so easy that you can't technically speak of doxxing. It has informed some of our views that we have communicated in the past weeks. If you do some research, things start to become clear.

https://t.co/l06l1l8clX"
3,doxxed,Just heard about the @Blockverse_NFT rug. The project sold out yesterday in less than 8 minutes (500 ETH) and had 792 ETH in secondary sales. Discord &amp; website closed and the anon devs are gone. Do we need a federated entity that approves all NFT projects and its doxxed founders?
4,doxxed,"Yes, @MutantXApe (minting today) is a scam. Undoxxed team, empty roadmap, Twitter account with 24k followers in 1 month, closed Discord with 100k members, and their AMA on YouTube was also made private. Apparently they used actors to feature in that AMA.

0,fully,"@Chodan_Bakri Respectfully, I disagree. A huge amount of incredible work doesn’t do well because of implicit bias and the unequal representation of genders within the space. Until we reach that equality, more effort needs to be put into amplifying underrepresented groups."
1,fully,"4/ All these people are in some way connected and/or use the same tactics. Take @andytreys_, who we called out earlier, and read the attachments carefully and you will see exactly the same pattern. https://t.co/FoE1degttW"
2,fully,"@digitalartchick – in your video from 22 Nov 2021 you said: ""I decided that I'm going to dox myself”. But in your message from 20 Jan 2022 you mention that you wished you had “stayed fully anon”. What is the latest and why your regrets? Asking for a fren. https://t.co/E1K90fa55B https://t.co/jshBafCfhm"
3,fully,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent

Your network is your net worth. We leveraged our IRL network to provide a pool of diverse leaders as mentors for our community to be matched with. 

The aim is to onboard more diverse folks and allow for knowledge sharing &amp; reciprocity within the space. https://t.co/UEDvI3KsIP"
2,community,"It takes a lot to build an #NFTproject. Most of it happens behind the scenes.

When TUS was born 4 weeks ago, we made a conscious decision to build in public and be transparent.

We spoke to @ChessyCollins, an amazing autistic, queer &amp; biracial leader. We covered:

🌈Empathetic leadership
🌈Unlearning unconscious bias 
🌈Advice for aspiring leaders

Join our discord to hear it first!"
4,community,There’s a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don’t know how I would do this without those people. 💖

3,utility,"1. OG crypto and NFT people are paranoid about future ""winters"". This is a cognitive bias; the ""curse of knowledge"". What's different now compared to 2018 is mass adoption, proven concepts, technology and utility. We're not getting another crypto winter."

0,transparent,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
1,transparent,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."
2,transparent,"Artists being able to verify the origins of their work in a transparent way, and buyers being able to see that verification - Yey"
3,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent

0,trust,"RIP Metabots. This isn't the first rug pull and won't be the last. Find a dev team you trust, and make sure the art isn't stolen! We could do with an overall ""background"" check of artwork of all recent collectibles tbh."
1,trust,6/ Let’s start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how “trustworthy” each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
2,trust,"22/ It’s interesting to realize that the Web2 world has instilled so much trust into the digital world, that scammers are abusing that trust and people are simply handing over their hard-earned money without any hesitation."
3,trust,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."

0,project,"10/ Let’s look at @ApesinSpaceNFT, a project by @1YoungTakeoff (who purchased a CryptoPunk with the profit that he made), what was shilled so much by @NFT that they even changed their profile picture into a Space Ape. https://t.co/Dvva14GGMh"
1,project,17/ In some podcasts you can’t escape the thought that they have used their young audience in the esports space to attract their parents to become part of this particular NFT project. The influence of esports/Fortnite streamers in the NFT space cannot be underestimated.
2,project,"With @MuriNFT being a legitimate collection by @haustwts, it shows that once a project does well and reputable, it immediately creates many copycats that try to benefit from a particular brand or its success. We have seen this with (Bored) Apes, Wolf Game, etc, etc."
3,project,"For those interested in a detailed background story about @SpacePoggersNFT and its founder @NiftyWhaleNFT, we refer to the extensive thread below. The project has completely new leadership now (under @RUG_TECH &amp; @natebear) and they confirmed the findings https://t.co/Cg2SZ9pDLq"

2,team,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, “ambassadors”, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot. Even though it was marked as “fake news”, a Discord message and recording shows otherwise https://t.co/hztXbSW3kw https://t.co/UBzguUxSMJ"
3,team,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
4,team,"If you are new to the NFT space, our advice would be not to mint ANY project for the coming 2 weeks. We have indications that the same scam team created many projects each day, and they only have a limited time window before they are found out. That's why they delay the ""reveal""."
