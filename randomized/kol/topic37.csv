0,like,For those that ever had any communication with the NFT influencer @Julialikesnfts - this is most likely a man who pretends to be a female. Full story here: https://t.co/PqkGgbtJFx https://t.co/Alsdn5fRdI
1,like,"An important read, especially to understand how entangled VCs are with money from anti-Web3 countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Two days ago Jared Kushner received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia for his new VC. His brother is an investor in @yugalabs.

2,like,"2/ The CEO of MoonPay, @isotowright, gave an interview with @theblock__, but some of the questions were not (properly) answered, so we would like to ask these questions again. The article can be found here (and we will refer to it in the tweets below): https://t.co/NIsofaeOtN"
3,like,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes.

4,like,"@WarewaPain @TheMetaTribes 99.9% likely it's a scam. 8 tweets, no website, no Discord and 54300 followers on Twitter, while not following anyone else. It's the same cartel of scammers - avoid at all costs. https://t.co/O5wkxKIrVv"
0,ive,"8/ An example is the below person. We had a mountain of evidence, but decided to test if a warning would help. Of course he didn‚Äôt respond to our ‚Äúwarning‚Äù, but we received indications that he changed his behavior and became a bit more careful. https://t.co/x6IMZttMYj"
1,ive,"2/ In real life, certain identifying data (name, (tax) ID, bank accounts, ‚Ä¶) can be compared to blockchain addresses. Based on (combinations of) that data everyone is able to trace our historical actions and it allows scrutiny over our personal and professional lives."

3,ive,"We received DMs from more than 10 people that @crocodood minting later today is a complete scam. We generally call out projects with high mint prices, but the DMs were so extensive (OGs &amp; mod team were banned for asking questions), that we have to share it

3,space,"6/ The SEC rules do not (yet) apply to the NFT space, but those that are ""abusing"" the ""decentralized system"" are ironically also the ones that will speed up regulation. There is always a tradeoff between individual freedom and collective responsibility. https://t.co/lYEViK5BwT"
4,space,"If you are new to the NFT space, our advice would be not to mint ANY project for the coming 2 weeks. We have indications that the same scam team created many projects each day, and they only have a limited time window before they are found out. That's why they delay the ""reveal""."
0,people,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
1,people,"When people say they love decentralization, it's often because they are part of a centralized narrative from a centralized network that requires you to exchange your currently ""centralized"" FIAT money to crypto, so that they can (ab)use that in a ""centralized"" way. The irony."
2,people,4/ We noticed you were posing in quite a fancy car. Can you explain why so many of those people in Dubai that are currently on our NFT radar are driving a Lambos? We did by the way appreciate you warning others for scam projects. Maybe add some self-reflection next time. https://t.co/kthOFHoxQd

Disability visibility &amp; inclusion for 1.85B of people is an integral part of the equity, diversity &amp; inclusion agenda. It can bring effective changes and universal innovation in Web3, Metaverse and NFT!
