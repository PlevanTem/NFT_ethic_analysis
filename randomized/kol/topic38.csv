0,blockchain,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."
1,blockchain,"@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts As already explained before - Web3 is about transparency, so asking this question is legitimate in our view. We communicate publicly, as transparent as the blockchain."
2,blockchain,"69/ Instead of competing with each other, we hope the NFT space is able to come up with new and innovative self-regulating mechanisms to create an ethical blockchain and ecosystem that doesn’t reward perverse incentives."
3,blockchain,"1. This is all public information and as we mentioned before: DNA is our biological blockchain
2. Get used to a decentralized world where people can't be censored
3. If you would have seen the documentary, you would have understood the analogy with NFTs

https://t.co/Tpks0TdFjr https://t.co/GQH78SVEZO"
4,blockchain,"What happens to BAYC if all 10k Bored Apes have been bought by (bored) celebrities? They all try to become part of an exciting new community, but will gradually realize that it’s the same community that they are already part of. Good thing you can't photoshop the blockchain."
0,chain,"We also hope @Twitter creates a feature that allows any user to see by whom they have been blocked. When logged into this account we can't access certain tweets/discussions, so it creates transparency (like the blockchain), which is a key feature of Web3.

https://t.co/zG1caS1Ad3"
1,chain,6/ Let’s start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how “trustworthy” each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.

0,decentralized,"6/ In the same way, if you want everyone to be part of a decentralized world without any centralized control, you need to add mechanisms to ensure that certain actors do not start to gain that centralized control."
1,decentralized,"7/ In a centralized world, the normal governance structure is top-down, but in a decentralized world it’s bottom-up. It should ideally (first) come from the individuals (us) and the NFT projects themselves: self-regulation."
2,decentralized,"The “Blockchain” is in some way an oxymoron, as no one can be blocked from it. We are thinking about the concept of the “Lockchain”: digital detention in a decentralized prison guarded by an authority-resistant authority. If you are in the Lockchain, you can't use the Blockchain."
3,decentralized,"4/ This is short list of the richest people in crypto. It does not feature the 2 billionaire founders of OpenSea and others. Ask yourself the question how it's possible that so much money is ""centralized"" to only a few people in this ""decentralized"" world.
https://t.co/eqstvBqeeH"
4,decentralized,13/ What does this all show? That not many people or organizations in a decentralized and unregulated space are able to responsibly and ethically use the power that they have been given by others.
0,transparency,"@Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts It's just an innocent question. Web3 is all about transparency, so we are curious why the tweets are protected. Nothing more."
1,transparency,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don’t mint. It’s quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."
2,transparency,This is a very unique and important project I feel. A touching and poignant insight into how cancer affects so many. *full disclosure/transparency this is something that has been created by one of my close friend’s elderly father

4,transparency,"2/ He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned they are “dedicated to improving transparency &amp; communication”. https://t.co/iJnn66neM2"
0,trust,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

https://t.co/ElH2kNiN7t"
1,trust,"Scammers are out in full force today. Quadruple check every link. Don’t trust ANYONE, not even your wife. Don’t look anyone in the eye. Be vigilant at all times. Question everything. Protect yourself."
2,trust,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"
3,trust,@beaniemaxi @mando_great @BoredApeYC @coolcatsnft @MetaHero_ @pixelvault_ @punkscomic @Matt_Furie @AvidLines @CryptoKitties @XCOPYART @fewocious @videodrome @Gfunkera86 We love the @pixelvault_! We don't really have a specific end goal at this stage but it feels good to create a mega collection and team up with someone you can trust. I'm sure it'll open up some avenues.
4,trust,"20/ And he mentions that people especially trusted @NFT because of Mark Cuban’s name on the page and the blue verified account. They tried to remove his name after this scandal came out, but the screenshots were already taken. https://t.co/r1aX2fNcf9"

0,smart,"7/ It is equally well-known that big corporations can make deals with many countries that allow them to have more favorable tax rates than the average Joe, and that they use all sorts of “smart” offshore constructions to minimize tax. https://t.co/xukz4d9qeZ"
1,smart,"5/ Some other insiders were “smarter” and decided to create new wallets to purchase lots of Meebits in advance of the announcement, including:

3,smart,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.
