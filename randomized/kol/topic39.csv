1,check,We would advise people to check your timeline and avoid any project that you are promoting. Because it's 99.9% likely that you are associated with the same organization that is creating all these scams and that also perfectly explains your response to us. https://t.co/W7crKYeVIg https://t.co/2Y8iBBGfPL
2,check,"49/ Beanie has admitted being a domain name investor, which is confirmed by doing a reverse WHOIS check on his real name. It is obvious in whose possession those valuable domain names are or were in case they have been resold. The domains were listed on https://t.co/bpvWhH592q. https://t.co/dUgpCIuQqk"
3,check,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico’s Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"
4,check,"25/ It was probably meant to create the illusion that CryptoBet or ChimpBet have a proper gambling license, because when we checked the status, it seems to be a sub-license of another company, of which there is no trace. The address is associated with another (gambling) company. https://t.co/MLVBeX5h6V"

1,available,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.

3,available,"1/ Today we learned that putting out publicly available and correct information is considered to be unethical. It was not negative news, but still people immediately perceived it like that, and started to attack the “messenger”, afraid that it might affect the value of their NFT."
4,available,"6/ Digital has invested in a variety of different companies in the Web3 space. As said - nothing we shared here is in any way new, and everything is publicly available and obvious for anyone who would search for this information. Many people are in some way (inter)connected. https://t.co/5O3bHfUNz7"
0,sold,"2/ The person in question is MontanaBlack with 1.1M Twitter followers. He basically says he didn't know it was a scam, and couldn't believe it was because it was so ""hyped"". He was happy that others pointed out it was a scam before everything sold out. And DYOR of course!"
1,sold,"22/ So if you see Mark Cuban on the stage, always remember that he is only a billionaire because he sold Audionet/Broadcast.com to Yahoo, which is considered the worst internet acquisition of all time. So he is used to selling worthless stuff to naïve “fools”. https://t.co/i3D0DxJ4uL"
2,sold,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"

0,trust,"Yes, @swipathefox rugged a project, because he didn't have any time. Should have thought about that before starting it. 
Certain (big) holders might be refunded, but the small ones, that don't have any influence, not. 

Know which NBA players not to trust.

1,trust,"58/ One common trait of a ""successful"" scammer is to call out other scams aggressively and as frequently as possible as it builds and increases a lot of trust. This is a tactic that Beanie is well aware of and frequently uses."
2,trust,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility 🤝💖"
3,trust,"We were contacted by a member of the community who said they claimed the original account for us, and has since handed over the handle. 
We didn’t trust this right away due to the murkiness of the entire situation."
4,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
0,eth,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"
1,eth,"16/ Many OG holders asking critical questions about the project were banned from the Discord. And when Beanie was asked whether he knew RGT, he denied ever having heard of it (see screenshots). But, in actual fact, it turns out he is the owner of RGT. https://t.co/rjhvuK8fyC"
2,eth,"19/ Some people want us to dox ourselves so that they can silence us IRL, something they tried but couldn’t do digitally. Others have questioned our credibility or ulterior motives."

4,eth,"Many people that are socially or financially invested in a project or person, seem to turn a blind eye to any ethical issues regarding that project or person. They measure morality in dollars or degree of loyalty/friendship. In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
