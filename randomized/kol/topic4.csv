0,4,ethical,13/ What does this all show? That not many people or organizations in a decentralized and unregulated space are able to responsibly and ethically use the power that they have been given by others.
1,4,ethical,"1/ In this thread we will summarize what we have tried to achieve in the past weeks and show the “bigger ethical picture” of the NFT space. We are at a crossroad and if we don’t take the right direction, we might well hit a dead end."
2,4,ethical,"24/ Are there no good people? Of course, there are. The majority is good, but as we already mentioned before this space favors the least ethical and most immoral persons, and they are productive and dominant in this space. And it influences others to behave unethically as well."
3,4,ethical,5/ It’s equally interesting however to look at the seemingly “good” or “reputable” people/organizations and how they have behaved. Were they able to behave ethically with all the power that they have? Were they better than Web2’s BigTech?
4,4,ethical,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"
0,4,world,Imagine that anyone in the world forwards you emails from their spam folder and asks you whether that email is legit or not. That is exactly how our inbox looks like. Lots of new people in this space that are not aware that lots of bad actors have joined the NFT space as well.
