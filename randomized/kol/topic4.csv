0,4,attack,"35/ After many complaints and suspected DOS attacks against competitor websites, Beanie apparently came under investigation by Canadian and US enforcement authorities and https://t.co/6sxOk3Wfz0 was discontinued. https://t.co/jhBq3cAuoy"
1,4,attack,"1/ Today we learned that putting out publicly available and correct information is considered to be unethical. It was not negative news, but still people immediately perceived it like that, and started to attack the “messenger”, afraid that it might affect the value of their NFT."
0,4,compound,"@vanshikaNFT @WFVnft @NityaNFT The power of compounding representation! 

We helped onboard you, @vanshikaNFT, and you’ve now helped onboard more WOC into this space🤝

Our co-founder @thisispaff was even onboarded by their partner @hrpeacock_ just 10 weeks ago. 

Were passionate abt building a diverse web3!"

0,4,based,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
1,4,based,"4/ This example highlights the issue of “perverse incentives”. Founders get most of the money during the minting process when the project is only based on “hype”. This continue during the “honeymoon period”, when still a lot of things are promised and OS royalties are flowing in."
2,4,based,"If you had looked at the company records for Ryan Carson's former company Treehouse, you would see an interesting name as director: Chamath Palihapitiya, king of SPACs. A billionaire who made more than $290 million based on a $25k investment.

🎓Curriculum-based, intersectional learning
✊🏽Onboarding underrepresented groups
🤝Mentorship program

4,4,based,"One of the problems is that all mint money for NFT projects goes straight to the founders without any effort and only based on promises and hype. It's difficult to assess whether a project is legitimate and we like the idea of performance based contracts:

0,4,app,"12/ Another account highlighted the below news story, which in actual fact appears much bigger and damning than anyone so far has published. The Twitter/IG handles of NFT were immediately deleted after this news story to bury the evidence

3,4,app,21/ The word “negro” is de facto “banned” and that also applies to the movie Emperor Tomato Ketchup. “No Sass” is not a common expression (in particular not for males) and could refer to the fact that Nazi symbols are banned in quite a lot of countries (no SA/SS). https://t.co/EMmEwD8Y8p

0,4,amazing,Full transparency: we had full belief and intention the reveal would happen when we said - the massive amount of variance proved to be a way larger job to sign off than anticipated. The collection is amazing. It will reveal within the next day when the team has slept.
1,4,amazing,@alienfrens @andrwwang @Deadfellaz Oh my gosh this is amazing! I would love this to go to @Mermaids_Gender please! They do incredible work supporting trans and gender diverse youth and their families. Thank you! 💖

0,4,collectibles,"10/ He invested in NBA Top Shot because “there's a trust authority behind these collectibles which makes it feel safer for me to invest in them."" Funny that he didn’t think that that would also apply to the “investors” in his previously abandoned projects. https://t.co/zCKpsfwaJJ"

0,4,announce,"22/ It makes it even more shameless to see that in Scalar Capital’s pitch deck, they explicitly mention that they bought 0x at $0.048. Fun fact: Coinbase just announced 0x Labs as their NFT partner and the price of ZRX skyrocketed. https://t.co/l5KMkEr67F"

3,4,announce,"10/ If someone asks about why they initially announced an astronaut to be part of the project, one of the founders said he screwed up and asks an ambassador to better answer the question. The ambassador then basically says: wait till after mint and then we go to the moon. https://t.co/G5CucS65CT"
4,4,announce,"5/ Some other insiders were “smarter” and decided to create new wallets to purchase lots of Meebits in advance of the announcement, including:

0,4,alike,For those that ever had any communication with the NFT influencer @Julialikesnfts - this is most likely a man who pretends to be a female. Full story here: https://t.co/PqkGgbtJFx https://t.co/Alsdn5fRdI
0,4,conclusion,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
1,4,conclusion,"@MrMuankana @larvalabs They said they are (1) ""not official Cryptopunks"", (2) ""we don't like them and we've got 1000"" and (3) ""so draw your own conclusions"". For someone reading between the lines that means basically ""worthless"". They should have released the statement before dumping them on others."
