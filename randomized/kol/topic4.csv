0,support,There’s a community within the larger NFT community of project founders giving each other moral support and guidance behind the scenes and I honestly don’t know how I would do this without those people. 💖
1,support,"To our Changemakers who supported us through our mint-weekend: THANK YOU. 🌻

We created TUS with a mission to create diverse leaders. Thanks to y’all we’re doing just that, with some of the most generous, kind &amp; brilliant folks in the #NFTCommunity.

This is just the beginning❤️ https://t.co/iu5Ym6dg8I"
2,support,"Not many understood the irony that we pointed out about founders wanting to get UAE residency for tax purposes. If you really support the true Web3 spirit, you don't want to support an authoritarian state with laws that are anti-Web3. It's hypocritical.

3,support,"@CafeMetaverse We’re Take Up Space - an NFT project focused on empowering LGBTQ+ &amp; BIPOC folks! One of our key initiatives is a Mentorship Program, matching mentees with diverse leaders as mentors to help provide support &amp; onboarding into the space. Hear it from one of our Changemakers here! https://t.co/HPpjG3Xccv"
4,support,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
