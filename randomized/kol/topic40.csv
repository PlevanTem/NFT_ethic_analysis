0,wallet,2/ We actually provided a respectable member of the NFT community earlier today with our wallet address(es) to verify our claims that we never took any money and have never abused our account for any personal gain. We are convinced they will come to the same conclusions.
1,wallet,"11/ The other Patron founder Jason Yeh is also an investor. Then we see anonymous profile “NCIZZLE”. This profile is associated with many different wallets, and it took us a bit of time to figure out who is behind it. https://t.co/AchUwR1e3S"
2,wallet,"So one of the founders of @LarvaLabs (LL) sells all 40 of his V1 Punks less than a week ago (for 260 ETH) via a 2nd wallet, and then LL releases an official statement that they are worthless. ""Leading by example"", they call that. More background here: https://t.co/2b4XuAzOt6 https://t.co/fN2Dw89xa9"
3,wallet,"@Katara_NFT Initially we thought that as well, but we received some DMs from people that mentioned wallets with many Otherdeeds and we checked these connections. It seems legit as also confirmed by @zachxbt.

1,hacked,"Just for the avoidance of doubt. The verified account @BhawanaCAN is an obvious scam promoting an ""Ape Coin airdrop"" and also the verified account of @ToddWasserman has been hacked and used for scamming.

3,need,"@Chodan_Bakri Respectfully, I disagree. A huge amount of incredible work doesn’t do well because of implicit bias and the unequal representation of genders within the space. Until we reach that equality, more effort needs to be put into amplifying underrepresented groups."
