Now that you have lost most of your credibility I think potential scammers might feel more encouraged. 

It’s a shame really."

Because queer POC need those wellbeing needs met before they can become diverse leaders in the first place."
3,support,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo

1,trust,"❓❓❓ How does TrustVibes app work?

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.
