1,rule,"21/ Anyone who has ever used online dating (everyone?) will understand this principle. The reality doesn’t often match the imagination, fortunately or unfortunately. But there are always exceptions to the rule, and scammers use these exceptions to convince you of the opposite."
2,rule,5/ Such events make you question who actually “rules the world” and how it’s possible that those that abused the system (e.g. banks) are actually rewarded for that by being bailed out. We have talked about perverse incentives before.
3,rule,"6/ The SEC rules do not (yet) apply to the NFT space, but those that are ""abusing"" the ""decentralized system"" are ironically also the ones that will speed up regulation. There is always a tradeoff between individual freedom and collective responsibility. https://t.co/lYEViK5BwT"
4,rule,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"
0,claim,"Disclaimer: we have already shown today that lots of ""scam projects"" are using similar kind of 3D images for the Metaverse (cats, bears, pigs). The above picture shows that it is not only limited to those projects, but to a much wider variety of projects that copy legitimate ones"
1,claim,"5/ And then there is a Twitter Spaces with Nima Ghassemi, the main co-founder, who claims that he will use 50% of the budget for marketing. But at the same time he also claims he has a very successful marketing company generating $3 million a year. 🤡https://t.co/Cw3lzW26cQ https://t.co/Bn70BZ5zSn"
2,claim,"1/2 - Dear @next_roy and @scott_lew_is, as the founders of @hyypeHQ, we noticed that Beanie/GM Capital claims to be an investor in Hyype. Please see the screenshots below on two of his main websites. https://t.co/wtaee0pYNx"
3,claim,"21/ Coinbase also altered its coin listing policy, potentially to accommodate Ox, which then became the first ERC-20 token to be listed. The choice to list Ox could be viewed as a blow to Coinbase's claims of transparency as 0x has a far smaller market cap than other coins. https://t.co/fzKm3A3Db2"
4,claim,"Quite a few people that claim to be or are perceived as “Artists” often forget to put the word “Con” in front of their supposed profession. Not everything that you can imagine is real – it’s often just fake, false and fraudulent. Intelligence has its limits, but stupidity not. https://t.co/JR8SbHmXoB"

1,web,"On the Twitter page and website of @WeatheReportNFT, they mention that ""a storm is coming"".

Not sure if they were referring to the document that the artist just released about this project, but it doesn't look good (or ethical).

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work.

4,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
