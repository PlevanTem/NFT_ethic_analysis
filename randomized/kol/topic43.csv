0,team,"We appreciate the fact that @bapesclan published the whole doxxed team on their webpage. It makes it much easier to do a bit of background checking (which saves us a lot of time), and we will certainly find much more about this project before minting.

1,team,"5/ It would explain why they spent so much money on traveling and also why the whole team had to go there. It also shows bad intent, because if the funds were going to be re-invested, it wouldn't be taxable income. https://t.co/vbGfHbgLUr"
2,team,"RIP Metabots. This isn't the first rug pull and won't be the last. Find a dev team you trust, and make sure the art isn't stolen! We could do with an overall ""background"" check of artwork of all recent collectibles tbh."
3,team,"Three months ago @nesotual was a co-founder of @gemxyz (see video at 6:28: https://t.co/UVZ8pu4d4F), but after the sexual misconduct allegations, @LorensHuculak mentioned he was a anon developer &amp; team member. Next time maybe also check out what other ENS profiles he registered. https://t.co/kwS6BwWXSb"
4,team,"So tomorrow HypeBears(Club) are going to mint for 0.4 (!) each, which would net the team a profit of 4000 ETH (&gt;$11 million). The team consisting of 3 anon &amp; very suspicious Twitter accounts, including one with a compromised account from an attorney. What could possibly go wrong? https://t.co/84NnYGgvsM"
0,eth,@NFTethics This for me is red-flag central. I think the NFT community would greatly benefit/learn something if you could use your detective skills to find some more information about exactly what happened here and what the full story is.
1,eth,"Worth a read by the journalist that exposed the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

Information wars have always existed and also actors (ab)using information asymmetries. It's something to be always conscious. Generally nothing is what it seems.

0,transparent,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
1,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
2,transparent,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don’t believe in gatekeeping. 

Here’s a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] 🧵👇🏽"
3,transparent,"@tothemaxy We've done several giveaways and we always screenshot the transfers. It's important to be transparent - especially in the crypto / NFT world.
Below are examples from two of our winners, who can vouch we're one of the good guys: @Charls020 &amp; @curioso_DR. 💚🦕 https://t.co/uDceOEim0x"
4,transparent,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."
0,project,"4/ This example highlights the issue of “perverse incentives”. Founders get most of the money during the minting process when the project is only based on “hype”. This continue during the “honeymoon period”, when still a lot of things are promised and OS royalties are flowing in."
1,project,"22/ Transparency pervades all domains and each person will be asked to provide certain basic input such as your wallet addresses, disclosures about (financial) relationships with (past/future) projects, alpha groups and/or other influencers (and their wallets)."
2,project,"23/ We do think that it is problematic when we don’t know the ulterior ideology/intentions of the founders, certainly when so much money is involved and all these opportunistic VCs and celebrities are blindly aping into this project. More clarity should be provided."
3,project,"1/ We have a couple of quick observations about the project @theshifters_ (90k Discord members), which will soon start minting. We were informed by multiple persons that tried to ask some questions that they were banned/blocked, so maybe it helps if we clarify their position."
4,project,"3/ We have a responsibility to uncover the truth, but also to release the information in a responsible way, by not doing any unnecessary damage to the NFT space, and certain projects/individuals. Especially when they have not had a chance to defend themselves against these claims"
0,transparency,"Many VCs/investors claim to love everything Web3: the transparency, the fact that everyone can participate and no one can be censored/blocked and that transactions on the blockchain are immutable. But they often behave the complete opposite way and they determine Web3's future. https://t.co/I8CiA1WOsY"
1,transparency,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."
2,transparency,"@CoachP1421 @MetaKryptVault Just to let you know that we have also been blocked by this person, even though we had never heard of this account before (and never reported about them). Maybe Twitter needs to consider adding an option that shows by which persons we have all been blocked (for transparency). https://t.co/SHJPIonToy"
3,transparency,@fvckrender Kindness and transparency or GTFO. 👏 https://t.co/TyCEOBnsEz
4,transparency,"@Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts It's just an innocent question. Web3 is all about transparency, so we are curious why the tweets are protected. Nothing more."
0,free,"21/ If anyone tries to make any critical comment about it, they are completely ridiculed. But others can freely say that no one cares about art and it’s all about the money. Being hypocritical has become an art in itself in this space. https://t.co/CHikSJRnyR"
1,free,"Marc Andreessen (a16z) talks a lot about how much he loves ""free speech"" on Twitter, but when the Saudi government ordered Khashoggi's assassination for exercising his free speech, Marc remained on the advisory board of NEOM, a project worth $500 billion and declined any comment. https://t.co/YIcn47IjHF"
2,free,4/ We noticed that some Bored and Mutant Apes have been transferred (for free) to MoonPay’s OS account from different other accounts including (for example) @nft42_/@j1mmyeth’s OS account. Can you clarify why that is the case and how these people have been compensated? https://t.co/AwVJmutf9t
3,free,Many scam projects have the same mod teams active on all their Discords. They are part of the team and in most cases (e.g. HypeBears) received free mints. It's interesting to see that they generally all immediately flipped these on OS: that's how much they believe in the project. https://t.co/OLF6KouaQb
4,free,"22/ Could it be that they wanted to address the notion of the freedom of speech and expression in various parts of society? Maybe. We found some more “coincidences”, but it would make us guilty of the prejudiced priming that Christopher Hitchens described."
0,real,"The CerealClub founders were also founders of a project about Kobe Bryant. Big team on the website https://t.co/eQweyduGoG, lots of people grinding in the Discord, but it got shut down. They didn't even have permission. Everyone left hung out to dry.

https://t.co/CqKe0otk18 https://t.co/SJp1jrxyuz"
1,real,"13/ More than 700 wealthy Russians obtained British citizenship between 2008 and 2015 as part of a program that granted visas to foreigners in exchange for investments in real estate. ""Dirty"" money and real estate also became more entangled. https://t.co/I7u6VzZzfn"
2,real,"6/ We can’t really find anything about this company which claims to be the number 1 Instagram growth agency, and the only reasonably long and neutral review is pretty negative. https://t.co/KxGt0yGWBm"
3,real,"If we want true diversity in #web3, we have to address the real world barriers that stop people from getting here, first. A thread 🧵

#NFTProject #WomenInNFTs #queerNFT #NFTProject"
4,real,"24/ Greg Solano wrote the below blog post and you sometimes cannot escape the thought that they have mixed real history with “fake history"" that is ""imagined and wonderful”. We don’t however know what is real and what is fake. We lack critical information. https://t.co/VOeMnMPI2a"
0,mint,"13/ If you are consistently showing opportunistic, selfish and unethical behavior (large amounts of wash trading, lots of TornadoCash’ing, lots of WL/minting abuse, lots of undisclosed paid ads revenue streams, etc, etc), your TRUSTH score will likely be low."
