1,value,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1

0,ethical,14/ We highlighted the story about Steven Cohen for a specific reason. This man founded the company that pleaded guilty to insider trading in one of the biggest criminal cases against a hedge fund and was able to accumulate his wealth in unethical ways. https://t.co/sxo6OQPWfg
1,ethical,"If you ever notice any unethical behavior in this space by anyone, first check how much ""good"" they have contributed to the NFT space. After that, realize that you yourself have not contributed anything and therefore you should simply remain silent. WAGMI!

3,ethical,17/ They will soon become so (financially) powerful and influential that they determine the (ethical) direction of this space. They will become too big to fail in this space.
4,ethical,13/ What does this all show? That not many people or organizations in a decentralized and unregulated space are able to responsibly and ethically use the power that they have been given by others.
0,trust,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"

4,metaverse,"8/ He also claims that they are using a lot of the funds for traveling. They always travel with the whole team (20+ people) together each week, which is a bit ironic for a project that claims to conquer the metaverse. Maybe first invent a metamansion to reduce your expenses."
0,transparency,"60/ He proclaims to like transparency but tries to remain as non-transparent as possible by using large numbers of different aliases, Twitter accounts, (anonymous) wallets, offshore proxies and front men to hide behind and manipulate people."

1,blockchain,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.

3,blockchain,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
4,blockchain,"6/ Even though the blockchain provides transparency, these people use the fact that their relationships IRL are not transparent and obvious. And so you are often deceived by a web of people that are IRL all (inter)connected and centralized."
