1,value,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds).

1,blockchain,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.
