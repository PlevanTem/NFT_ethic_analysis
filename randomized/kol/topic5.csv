0,5,benefit,"24/ We mentioned earlier that self-regulation is key to move this space further (mainstream). To add an incentive: those that will be able to come up with ethical solutions, will likely be the ones that will financially benefit from this space the most. https://t.co/t61tJy9a63"
1,5,benefit,"25/ This thread serves as some background for the upcoming thread(s) about VCs. As so often cynical people who exactly know how the world works are (ab)using naive and good-hearted people (teenagers, artists, etc) who are (blissfully) ignorant for their own benefit and agendas."
2,5,benefit,"20/ Exposing Beanie was financially the worst decision that we could have personally made, but we did it and didn‚Äôt sell any NFTs before his exposure. We also never benefited from trading in NFTs in any way by using this account and the blockchain will provide that."
3,5,benefit,"@jpegenthusiast_ We already know who you are, so what is the benefit (for you or the holders) of releasing this information in a few days instead of now?"
4,5,benefit,"5/ In Web2 the big influencers benefit from everything they do know about us. In Web3, the big (anonymous) influencers benefit from everything we do not know about them. But they both (try to) influence our behavior for profit and capitalize on it for their own benefit."
0,5,cat,"@SerpentAU Because you said all ""the articles were publicity stunts"", almost suggesting that the information in those articles was fake or fabricated. This is the original tweet just for reference purposes."
1,5,cat,"8/ An example is the below person. We had a mountain of evidence, but decided to test if a warning would help. Of course he didn‚Äôt respond to our ‚Äúwarning‚Äù, but we received indications that he changed his behavior and became a bit more careful. https://t.co/x6IMZttMYj"
2,5,cat,"@areaeighteen We love @HoneyBadgesNFT - actively funding Changemakers and bringing more diverse folk into web3! 

@MMonstersClub are LGBTQ owned &amp; operated, are providing accessible education for marginalised folks 

@MadJellyHQ diverse-led &amp; always advocate for inclusivity &amp; equity in web3"
3,5,cat,"Yes, scammers are getting smarter and the NFT space has lost the innocence that it once had when the majority of people involved were truly trying to build things. 

The is a very sophisticated story of manipulation and scamming:

0,5,asks,"24/ Also remember that if you ever see a tweet from @jf_nft in which he asks which NFT to buy, he is likely buying it with your money that he gained via all kinds of dodgy scams. This whole space is filled with charlatans, and many are high profile names that operate in networks."
1,5,asks,"So we just asked an innocent but legitimate question to @aatwts and we received a lot of criticism, but now understand why. He asked his followers to spam us, and even asks people to lie that we blocked people. Amazing.

We have never ever blocked anyone.

2,5,asks,Imagine that anyone in the world forwards you emails from their spam folder and asks you whether that email is legit or not. That is exactly how our inbox looks like. Lots of new people in this space that are not aware that lots of bad actors have joined the NFT space as well.
3,5,asks,"Someone sees HypeFriends (HF) using 2-year old art and asks them: is this your artist? ""Yes, it's our designer"", they say! Then we ask @Lomax71809176 and he tells HF stole his art. HF then quickly deletes their tweets and turns the story around: he left us 2 weeks ago. Red Flag! https://t.co/5bszFxlJW8"
4,5,asks,"10/ If someone asks about why they initially announced an astronaut to be part of the project, one of the founders said he screwed up and asks an ambassador to better answer the question. The ambassador then basically says: wait till after mint and then we go to the moon. https://t.co/G5CucS65CT"
