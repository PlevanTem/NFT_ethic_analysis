0,5,best,"3/ This is not the best way of using our time. Many scammers, fraudsters, thieves and criminals IRL are behaving in the same in the digital world, so it only confirms what most will already know. There are also too many to report about."
1,5,best,"Did you know our co-founders @hrpeacock_ and @thisispaff have the best queerest lovestory of all time?! 

Hear all about + how TUS was founded, coming out late &amp; why diversity in web3 is SO important👇🏽

HUGE thank you to @QueerRise for making space❤️‍🔥🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

3,5,best,9/ Yesterday was another Spaces with Bapes ambassadors. They all talk as if this project is the best thing since sliced bread. Zero self-reflection or a warning to people that don’t know anything about NFTs that the value of most NFT projects will go to 0. https://t.co/T7bXYTnw9D
4,5,best,"Paff began working on how best they could help create more diverse leaders and quickly stumbled across a problem.

0,5,transparent,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don’t believe in gatekeeping. 

Here’s a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] 🧵👇🏽"
1,5,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
2,5,transparent,"It takes a lot to build an #NFTproject. Most of it happens behind the scenes.

When TUS was born 4 weeks ago, we made a conscious decision to build in public and be transparent.

4,5,transparent,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk
0,5,earn,"Publishing the below thread on April Fool’s Day would have been a bit too obvious, so we decided to do it one month earlier. We appreciated all the comments and maybe you might understand the irony at some point.

0,5,play,There was a time when everyone in the Web3/crypto/NFT space was supporting each other with a common goal to make this tech more mainstream. But now our paths are diverging and we are all playing musical chairs. It's a beautiful interplay between human cooperation and competition.
1,5,play,Cultural and social significance of something play huge roles in how we determine value. As does bias. These same concepts apply to digital items in an increasingly digital world.

0,5,game,4/ We have heard various people say that this is simply the “dark side of decentralization” and it’s just “part of the game”. But we believe that might well be a logical fallacy. Let’s give some examples.
1,5,game,"17/ Gargamel mentioned in an interview that they ""knew all about what this world was"", things are not ""just random"" which can also be concluded from the complicated puzzle that BAYC posted that ultimately could only be deciphered by a team of professionals https://t.co/rtp0fdAY6t https://t.co/oYjLHfDYty"
2,5,game,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately “survive”, so the current state of the market is that “bad news” for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
