0,soon,"17/ Another prominent person, who is soon dropping his own NFT, is @jeremyfall. He was involved in @NFT was well, but deleted all tweets/references about it. Luckily we still have the articles that connect him and he seems now also cyber squatting IG accounts. https://t.co/FAWEppHirZ"
1,soon,"24/ This is partly because on Yuga Labs Pitch Deck, two of these persons are characterized as “minority partners”. We will also soon publish a similar sort of thread about the VCs involved in this space. That promises to be even more fun. https://t.co/yhM39v50Od"
2,soon,"Dear Tyler (@tyler_free007 &amp; @thefurykiwi), not sure why you are using 2 accounts for the same person, but we have not forgotten what you did with the @electric_punks (the @PixelDAlliance &amp; Thelilguys). Are you also going to release your own defense statement soon? @FreeGuys_eth https://t.co/DydlA4gumn"
3,soon,"25/ To quote Jason again: ""we're all in this TOGETHER. And remember WAGMI."" Especially the billionaires that have already made it and who are going to make much and much more. We will write more about all these billionaires soon. https://t.co/32LGOTXpcY"
4,soon,"@flynnkristina @Science_stanley @rollnwthehomies @some_place @LanaHopkins3 @jdisimone_ Considering accessibilty needs whatever we're developing in the space. It's really important to normalise disability inclusion &amp; talking about it in the context of equity &amp; diversity. We're talking 1.2B ppl. I often face the problem of ""charitable"" as soon as I mention disability"
0,reward,5/ Such events make you question who actually “rules the world” and how it’s possible that those that abused the system (e.g. banks) are actually rewarded for that by being bailed out. We have talked about perverse incentives before.

✔ Creators do not receive fair rewards for work. 
✔ Distribution of rewards for authors is not transparent.

4,reward,"Many people active in NFTs have backgrounds in high-risk/reward activities (traders, gamblers, entrepreneurs, criminals, etc) with a short-term ""investment"" horizon, which makes them intrinsically not suitable to build projects which require a long-term vision to generate value."

3,earn,"@jucamunga @shakkablood @HPPRSNFT You’re right, we’re all learning. It’s good to reflect on it all as we go and I appreciate the discussion! Even presale spots from other communities can feel risky as it’s almost completely utilising the trust already built in one community for something that isn’t established."

0,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent

1,play,"10/ As an important player in the crypto/NFT space, do you think that MoonPay should (continue to) provide a service that actually makes transactions less transparent? It is now for example not possible for us to see if/how much Gwyneth Paltrow paid for her Bored Ape."

We hope that any new players will choose the influencers that they want to work with very wisely in the future.

3,play,1/ A quick thread about the importance and current lack of ethics in the NFT space. We have noticed that a lot of the same persons are involved in multiple rugs. It’s probably even fair to say that there is a very small cartel of influential players that are serial ruggers.

1,game,"17/ Gargamel mentioned in an interview that they ""knew all about what this world was"", things are not ""just random"" which can also be concluded from the complicated puzzle that BAYC posted that ultimately could only be deciphered by a team of professionals https://t.co/rtp0fdAY6t https://t.co/oYjLHfDYty"
2,game,"@saxyjacky Co director of a creative production agency servicing large corporations for things like visuals, videos, games etc. Then also a community organiser for women and gender diverse people to receive connection and mutual aid."
3,game,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately “survive”, so the current state of the market is that “bad news” for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
