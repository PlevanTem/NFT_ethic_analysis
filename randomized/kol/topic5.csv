4,5,play,@NFTherder We now receive 200 DM's per day with projects that we never heard of. Most of them all use the same playbook. We can't check each of the 100's of projects that are coming out each day and wanted to give people a general harsh warning. Sometimes it's better to be safe than sorry.

0,5,game,4/ We have heard various people say that this is simply the “dark side of decentralization” and it’s just “part of the game”. But we believe that might well be a logical fallacy. Let’s give some examples.
1,5,game,"3/ The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately “survive”, so the current state of the market is that “bad news” for other projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general."
2,5,game,"18/ In that puzzle, they do make use of some ingenious pattern combinations and some people have therefore made suggestions that the names of the BAYC founders might reveal more about them. Especially since Gargamel mentioned Hemingway’s Iceberg theory. https://t.co/6ZQ8F4ZcjX"
