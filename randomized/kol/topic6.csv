0,6,avoid,"Of course @DoodlesCatsNFT that is minting today is a scam. The only thing they are interested in is paying fake influencers with &gt;100k followers to promote and sell out. No engagement with the community, no website, nothing. When you have (serious) doubts about a project, avoid. https://t.co/ffwvprkZ9u"
1,6,avoid,"In some way it's unnecessary to also mention the project FashionApe, but because it's minting this week and just for the avoidance of doubt - it's all the same scam over and over again (just like MetaTribes) https://t.co/EK5eFypES5 https://t.co/ksZ1fYcH1m"

3,6,avoid,We would advise people to check your timeline and avoid any project that you are promoting. Because it's 99.9% likely that you are associated with the same organization that is creating all these scams and that also perfectly explains your response to us. https://t.co/W7crKYeVIg https://t.co/2Y8iBBGfPL
4,6,avoid,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.
0,6,bad,"5/ And @tailopez, who seems to be much better able to make a fool out himself than we would ever be able to. We thank him for raising so much awareness about bad actors in this space, including himself. https://t.co/ehhYcUET1r"
1,6,bad,"More than 3 months ago, the ratio of well intentioned projects and bad intentioned ones was probably around 80%-20%. 

That ratio has in our view shifted: 80% are now likely scams and 20% are projects that really want to build something.

This makes sense:

2,6,bad,2/ Most people active in the NFT space have now (finally) seen the amount of bad actors that are very active/productive and they manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways. The most problematic is when they continue to remain or become more influential in this space.
3,6,bad,"People often conflate being doxxed with operating in an ethical way and being trustworthy. The two are not mutually exclusive - people both doxxed and anon are capable of both good and bad things, how we navigate that is ultimately our personal responsibility ü§ùüíñ"
4,6,bad,"5/ It would explain why they spent so much money on traveling and also why the whole team had to go there. It also shows bad intent, because if the funds were going to be re-invested, it wouldn't be taxable income. https://t.co/vbGfHbgLUr"
