1,6,account,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1

3,6,account,"3/ One profile clearly shows involvement in this project and his real Twitter account is screenshotted below. The reason we know this is that when he handed over the project to the community, people discovered this. https://t.co/JvDzlrchti"
4,6,account,"For those who don't know about the dubious history of the account NFTmachine. He blocked us immediately for a reason, even though we never reported about him. He probably knew we would however at some point do that.

All credits to @0xShual.

0,6,actually,"FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out https://t.co/R5eRU4VBXV"
1,6,actually,"Even when you think everything with a project is going well - it's still possible that things are wrong with the underlying smart contract and that the art/metadata is actually centralized on a website that is about to expire. A technical rug?

https://t.co/3yi82PAf5L"
2,6,actually,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of “democracy” to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
3,6,actually,"4/ Unnecessary to say that these people often have a financial incentive to do so. That will become increasingly more clear: while you think this is a decentralized world, there are actually small centralized groups that benefit the most from the NFT space. https://t.co/HSRvRuUNeI"

0,6,transparent,@DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts That is not correct. The warning have always been publicly communicated - otherwise it defies the purpose of being transparent. We should be allowed to ask legitimate questions without people immediately thinking that a project is a rug or a scam. https://t.co/HvGblQyfbk
1,6,transparent,@0xNFTCritic I believe we do that every day. When we support any large company do we really know where our money is going? Is there a transparent supply chain or money trail? Often no. It’s a similar thing imo
2,6,transparent,"Artists being able to verify the origins of their work in a transparent way, and buyers being able to see that verification - Yey"
3,6,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
4,6,transparent,"@tothemaxy We've done several giveaways and we always screenshot the transfers. It's important to be transparent - especially in the crypto / NFT world.
Below are examples from two of our winners, who can vouch we're one of the good guys: @Charls020 &amp; @curioso_DR. 💚🦕 https://t.co/uDceOEim0x"
0,6,tweet,1/ We will limit our tweets about upcoming scam projects because we would otherwise be sending out tweets every minute. We just follow up on Bapes(Clan) as that is a project with doxed people and as such is quite unusual.
1,6,tweet,"It's interesting to see that @cerealclubnft deleted the 2 tweets about the involvement of 2 high level execs from SnapChat. The same Jeff Miller also promoted HypeBears, but deleted that message.

It confirms what we were already thinking...

3,6,tweet,"Someone sees HypeFriends (HF) using 2-year old art and asks them: is this your artist? ""Yes, it's our designer"", they say! Then we ask @Lomax71809176 and he tells HF stole his art. HF then quickly deletes their tweets and turns the story around: he left us 2 weeks ago. Red Flag! https://t.co/5bszFxlJW8"

0,6,thread,"1/ In this thread we will disclose the identity of one of the (currently) most (in)famous NFT influencers. But before we do that, we first explain our (philosophical) justifications and provide some important disclaimers."
1,6,thread,"25/ This thread serves as some background for the upcoming thread(s) about VCs. As so often cynical people who exactly know how the world works are (ab)using naive and good-hearted people (teenagers, artists, etc) who are (blissfully) ignorant for their own benefit and agendas."

3,6,thread,"Later today @moonpay CEO @isotowright will be on stage of @NFTLAlive, so it's good to remind him again of the below thread. When we posted it, he stopped using Twitter for almost one and a half month, so he did have enough time to think about the answers.

1,6,nft,"1/ We received quite a lot of requests to look at @metamansionsnft, which is minting later this week. The mint price alone (0.88 ETH) is already a red flag, but there are many more. They are doing a “giveaway” of 888 ETH (10% of the mint profit) but only when it sells out AND…"

4,6,nft,"2/ They would either reach out to celebrities or celebrities would contact them, so if you have been rugged, know that @jf_nft/@0xAA_NFT were responsible. They allegedly told insiders not to buy what they posted at @NFT IG because they knew they were rugs.
https://t.co/0wtvrvj7E2"
0,6,rug,"The project @nftsphantoms minting later today is very likely a scam by the same people that rugged already 10+ other projects.

https://t.co/XyoDKwweSk"
1,6,rug,"7/ One of these scams is @MissUniverseNFt and it was not mentioned on the overview in the orginal thread. This was a project that @NFT heavily promoted, even with AMA’s with the “founder”, but it was a rug and the website of the Miss Universe has been deleted. https://t.co/uFbwMfDy3w"
2,6,rug,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.

https://t.co/asFIFOFxSl https://t.co/HODRXFpgTt"

0,6,look,"The existence of LGBTQ+ people can't be legislated away!

TUS is founded by Paff &amp; Han, a lesbian couple that looks to help others fight inequality, live boldly and be their authentic selves.

Why the world needs more diverse leaders 👇🏽🧵 https://t.co/6aGnTH3KLd"
1,6,look,"12/ The last entry of his blog was on 14 April 2020, and up until that point he always mentioned his girlfriend M., but when looking deeper at properties that were purchased after April 2020, we noticed that another name came up: Gabriella Falcon. https://t.co/ouf4A1hN9R"
2,6,look,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."
3,6,look,"It looks like the SEC's experience with @ElonMusk, the owner of the first NFT Company or Company NFT that was shilled on Twitter, will likely serve as a blueprint for the future regulation of NFTs. More background here: https://t.co/KU17A6PENE"
4,6,look,"13/ Her Instagram account has now been deleted, but in her IG bio, she only mentioned one word: cowabunga. We have to admit that we had never heard of that word, so had to look up “reliable” sources to understand if this could mean anything. https://t.co/IBnQsFHXvh"
0,6,like,"@WarewaPain @TheMetaTribes 99.9% likely it's a scam. 8 tweets, no website, no Discord and 54300 followers on Twitter, while not following anyone else. It's the same cartel of scammers - avoid at all costs. https://t.co/O5wkxKIrVv"
1,6,like,"8/ Zagabond has an investment banking background (like quite a few NFT influencers) and moved after a brief stint at Amazon to Google, before spending the last 4 years at 0x Labs. He mentioned that he left his job in September 2021, which is confirmed by his now deleted tweet. https://t.co/rBN5DWZ30L"
2,6,like,"13/ If you are consistently showing opportunistic, selfish and unethical behavior (large amounts of wash trading, lots of TornadoCash’ing, lots of WL/minting abuse, lots of undisclosed paid ads revenue streams, etc, etc), your TRUSTH score will likely be low."
3,6,like,"23/ If you don’t disclose this information, but it is found out by others/algorithms, it can have an impact on your TRUSTH scores. It’s unfortunate that mechanisms and measures like this are necessary, but as we said earlier: https://t.co/SfSzt0fesq"
4,6,like,"9/ When looking at Zagabond’s digital footprint, he was involved in daily fantasy sports (like quite a few NFT influencers) and seemed to have a preoccupation with money, asking for the quickest way to make $1000 USD and selling lots of his used clothes. https://t.co/grPMuaUtCZ"
0,6,project,"7/ We think @NFTherder might create a thread about Zagabond’s blockchain transactions (across the different projects that he was involved in), so we will focus on the IRL relationships. As we said before: https://t.co/l06l1l8clX"
1,6,project,"1/ For those people asking why we always come up with ""FUD"" on projects on mint day. We generally have never heard of any of these projects, but we receive currently about 200 DMs per day. We had received between 5-10 about CerealClub and actually more than 5 about Bunny Buddies."

3,6,project,"Imagine a scenario of huge consolidation where 1 successful/rich NFT project buys up lots of other promising and undervalued NFT projects and then, after a year, decides to sell it all to Meta/Facebook, Microsoft or any VC. From Web 3.0 to REKT 4.0. Welcome to The Metaverse 19.84"
4,6,project,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.
