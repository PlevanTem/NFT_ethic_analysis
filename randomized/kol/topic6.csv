2,6,account,"@TGTOWYT All Twitter accounts are old, but 2 of them (TheRickk &amp; Jpegenthusiast) don't have any tweets prior to Nov 2021. The account from xy_square is compromised. Check any of the 6000 older tweets. MAYC is mentioned in the founder's profile, but he doesn't own any. There is no roadmap."

Check any of the 6000 older tweets (it's from an attorney). MAYC is mentioned in founder's profile, but he doesn't own any."
4,6,account,"40/ Even though Beanie has often mentioned that he never had any social online presence, this was certainly not true. He used to have a Twitter account with over 12k followers, a Facebook account and a LinkedIn profile. https://t.co/CMpAyolbdj"
0,6,actually,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
1,6,actually,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

2,6,actually,"5/ However, when the actual work needs to be done, most of the founders have already made enough money to retire and have less of an incentive (or none at all) to actually put in the work that they promised from the start."
3,6,actually,"16/ Since people have become more hesitant about projects with non-doxxed founders, these scam rings now often pay ‚Äúpuppets‚Äù that pretend that they are the ‚Äúfounders‚Äù, so that naive people think that the founders are actually doxed."
4,6,actually,"FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out https://t.co/R5eRU4VBXV"
0,6,transparent,"@tothemaxy We've done several giveaways and we always screenshot the transfers. It's important to be transparent - especially in the crypto / NFT world.
Below are examples from two of our winners, who can vouch we're one of the good guys: @Charls020 &amp; @curioso_DR. üíöü¶ï https://t.co/uDceOEim0x"

All profits go to charity. 

I'd work on this for free if people are interested hmu."

3,6,transparent,@NateAlexNFT My favourite thing is how it‚Äôs not a transparent GIF so when the sun sets and Twitter goes to dark mode I can see the outlines
4,6,transparent,"Artists being able to verify the origins of their work in a transparent way, and buyers being able to see that verification - Yey"
0,6,tweet,"Yes, @AB84 is known to promote NFT projects for money and without doing any due diligence. He also tweeted about Vault of Gems, which was a complete scam by the same team that rugged many other projects. 

And then he deletes all tweets from his timeline.

1,6,tweet,"3/ The tweets by @gmcapital_ have now all been conveniently deleted, but many people were planning to invest in this fund and we potentially saved them tens of millions of dollars. We explicitly mentioned this as a justification for his doxxing https://t.co/t8bn2QXNiQ"
2,6,tweet,"@Crypto__Jesus_ @aatwts @haustwts It's just an innocent question. Web3 is all about transparency, so we are curious why the tweets are protected. Nothing more."
3,6,tweet,"The response from @bapesclan to our thread was disappointing to say the least (screenshots and voice: https://t.co/FJxkkBiZo3)

Thanks to @Rug_Watch, also for finding a Covid-scam that another founder was involved in. He has deleted his tweet (as usual).

4,6,tweet,"2/4 Some characteristics are: low number of tweets, no content only hype (no interaction with followers), large number of followers via fake competitions/WL promises, many bot followers, no Discord/no doxxed founders, low number of mints/high mint price, etc, etc, etc."
0,6,thread,"Later today @moonpay CEO @isotowright will be on stage of @NFTLAlive, so it's good to remind him again of the below thread. When we posted it, he stopped using Twitter for almost one and a half month, so he did have enough time to think about the answers.

3,6,thread,"25/ This thread serves as some background for the upcoming thread(s) about VCs. As so often cynical people who exactly know how the world works are (ab)using naive and good-hearted people (teenagers, artists, etc) who are (blissfully) ignorant for their own benefit and agendas."
4,6,thread,"1/ This is going to be a bit of a controversial thread, so just some disclaimers. We are free speech maximalists and ‚Äútruths‚Äù can be inconvenient or politically incorrect, which could make them to certain people ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù, but it doesn‚Äôt make them less ‚Äútrue‚Äù."
0,6,nft,"1/ We received quite a lot of requests to look at @metamansionsnft, which is minting later this week. The mint price alone (0.88 ETH) is already a red flag, but there are many more. They are doing a ‚Äúgiveaway‚Äù of 888 ETH (10% of the mint profit) but only when it sells out AND‚Ä¶"

0,6,rug,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

https://t.co/ElH2kNiN7t"
1,6,rug,"7/ One of these scams is @MissUniverseNFt and it was not mentioned on the overview in the orginal thread. This was a project that @NFT heavily promoted, even with AMA‚Äôs with the ‚Äúfounder‚Äù, but it was a rug and the website of the Miss Universe has been deleted. https://t.co/uFbwMfDy3w"
2,6,rug,"4/ We also received info that they have been involved in another rug called MonaLisa. The person behind the names Omster, Omkar, Dr. Moo seems to be related. https://t.co/iHISU7JmXB"
3,6,rug,"Yes, @swipathefox rugged a project, because he didn't have any time. Should have thought about that before starting it. 
Certain (big) holders might be refunded, but the small ones, that don't have any influence, not. 

Know which NBA players not to trust.

4,6,rug,"Soon we will report about 3 scam rings originating from the same country (UAE) that have been responsible for &gt;4 rug pulls each (3D projects). Mainly french speaking with connections to Canada/France. Some have &gt;4M followers on IG. We will report names, so it requires more rigor."
0,6,look,"@Mladek_eth I feel we‚Äôre currently representing a depressing reflection of the traditional art world in terms of diversity if we look at the top sales etc, but as my good friend @mecdot says , the paint isn‚Äôt dry, the concrete isn‚Äôt set, we still have chance to change it."
1,6,look,@smkzzzz Please check our tweets in the past days. There are so many and they all look the same. Same playbook. Some paid Instagram/Twitter accounts that shill them.
2,6,look,"NEW ARTIST Welcome to the #TrustVibes Family, Singer &amp; Composer @EuCaioCortez üé∂. Last year Caio's music was streamed over 31K times to 18.4K Listeners on @spotifyartists.

3,6,look,"2/ It was still interesting to see that the Head of Consumer Product Marketing at Twitter, @TheSmarmyBum, bought Meebits well before the announcement and we look forward to hearing his perspective on insider trading in this space. https://t.co/5AeNwXlWGP"
4,6,look,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We are not saying that, but we do hope that more experts like you do a deep dive into all those similarly looking and advertised projects that minted in the past week and are about to mint that are all connected. Could potentially be the biggest ""heist"" in NFT history."
0,6,like,@NFTethics @farokh @RugRadio @greatmando_nft @belikewater893 @pranksy I also stated I invested here üëç:
1,6,like,"One of the problems is that all mint money for NFT projects goes straight to the founders without any effort and only based on promises and hype. It's difficult to assess whether a project is legitimate and we like the idea of performance based contracts:

https://t.co/qSBnqwhdLY"
2,6,like,"7/ We will likely see increasingly more consolidation of projects, and only those projects that have the right (transparent) incentives and risk-reward mechanisms in place will survive and thrive. A shift from short-term gain toward long-term investment/sustainability is required"
3,6,like,"In some way it's unnecessary to also mention the project FashionApe, but because it's minting this week and just for the avoidance of doubt - it's all the same scam over and over again (just like MetaTribes) https://t.co/EK5eFypES5 https://t.co/ksZ1fYcH1m"
4,6,like,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
0,6,project,"2/ That project is also minting today. All these individuals generally DM us on mint day or the day before to warn us that they think the project is a scam given their extensive experiences in the Discord. It remains very difficult to check if that is always the case, because..."
1,6,project,"We simply have to all agree that we don‚Äôt mint any project with mint prices &gt;0.1 (ideally lower). It will disincentive scammers to go for cash grabs, will keep more liquidity in the NFT/ETH ecosystem and will create more innovation in this space (e.g. performance-based contracts)"
2,6,project,"2/ People feel especially betrayed by the fact that only 30 ETH was left in the community fund for further development, while 90 ETH in total seemed to have been paid to some of the moderators. The founders seem to have left the project with more than 1700 ETH."
3,6,project,"8/ He also claims that they are using a lot of the funds for traveling. They always travel with the whole team (20+ people) together each week, which is a bit ironic for a project that claims to conquer the metaverse. Maybe first invent a metamansion to reduce your expenses."
4,6,project,"The below project minting today would rake in 21800-27275 ETH. Worst case: &gt;$80 million.

Scammers know that people are getting smarter by the day. So why not try it one more time in a big way?

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.
