0,scammer,"1/4 Twitter has become the primary vehicle for scammers to get attention for their NFT project. Many of us will quite quickly be able to see whether a Twitter account belongs to scammers or not, in the same way that most people are quickly able to identify email spam."
1,scammer,"Why scammers &amp; fraudsters thrive? Research shows that people tend to default to trusting others over distrusting them, believing them over doubting them and going along with someone‚Äôs self-presentation rather than embarrassing them by calling them out. https://t.co/KAu7BQh7JG"
2,scammer,"Sad to see that the same group of prolific serial scammers continue with their rugs: Boss Apes (minting now), Pikapunks, LazyLionz (with a Z), Hype Ape Club, Cyber Charizard, Bored CloneX, Dogdles, etc. Each week a new project, facilitated by the same 10-20 large Twitter accounts https://t.co/3GqByCtzdt"
3,scammer,"21/ Anyone who has ever used online dating (everyone?) will understand this principle. The reality doesn‚Äôt often match the imagination, fortunately or unfortunately. But there are always exceptions to the rule, and scammers use these exceptions to convince you of the opposite."
4,scammer,"1/2 Never get deceived by seemingly good gestures. There is a scammer out there (twitter handle: LurkingisNicer), who rugged the @ElephantNFTS  project and put in his Twitter profile that he donated $50k to charity. He scammer someone recently out of $8000 https://t.co/MeYIAVaGl1 https://t.co/FDKHtPD02b"
0,like,"Everyone loves decentralization until you realize that it allows some to ""abuse"" their individual freedom at the expense of the collective.

Everyone dislikes centralization until you realize that it allows many to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the collective freedom at the expense of the individual."
1,like,We would advise people to check your timeline and avoid any project that you are promoting. Because it's 99.9% likely that you are associated with the same organization that is creating all these scams and that also perfectly explains your response to us. https://t.co/W7crKYeVIg https://t.co/2Y8iBBGfPL
2,like,"23/ If you don‚Äôt disclose this information, but it is found out by others/algorithms, it can have an impact on your TRUSTH scores. It‚Äôs unfortunate that mechanisms and measures like this are necessary, but as we said earlier: https://t.co/SfSzt0fesq"
3,like,19. So make sure you use something like TokenTax to figure out what you owe and have that money set aside. Don't avoid taxes. There's no hiding. That's the beauty of blockchain; all the information is publicly available. Not worth the risk and it's not ethical or legal.
4,like,6/ This starts to get more problematic when a company like Yuga Labs (valued at over $4 billion) already raised so much money and is expected to raise even more this Saturday (some claim $840m in total proceeds). It is quite unprecedented to do this with so little accountability. https://t.co/XI9ixLrKe1
0,scam,"@SerpentAU Our comment was to highlight a general issue that many might not be aware of. This is less/not of an issue for legitimate projects, but if you own art from a ""scam project"" that doesn't care about the project long-term, it is possible that you can technically ""lose"" your NFT."
1,scam,"10/ Of course only wallets with significant NFT assets and high TRUSTH scores may be deemed reputable enough to invest in (with or without doxed teams), so we don‚Äôt have to constantly assess each upcoming project and in particular all these scam projects."
2,scam,"@WarewaPain @TheMetaTribes 99.9% likely it's a scam. 8 tweets, no website, no Discord and 54300 followers on Twitter, while not following anyone else. It's the same cartel of scammers - avoid at all costs. https://t.co/O5wkxKIrVv"
3,scam,"The project @DeluxeGoat is 99.9% a scam (also minting today). Founders have 0 and 1 post on IG. They paid for Google ads, and one of the founders could well be the same one as the one from ""Immortal Apes"" as he writes gas both times in an unusual (and incorrect) way. Gass what? https://t.co/RamDHzBDxe"
4,scam,"We recently mentioned that ""scammers have entered the NFT space at an industrial scale"". Some exceptional and altruistic individuals in this space have provided us with evidence of wallet connections linking many of these scam projects. This is very big and will soon be revealed."

1,account,"12/ Another account highlighted the below news story, which in actual fact appears much bigger and damning than anyone so far has published. The Twitter/IG handles of NFT were immediately deleted after this news story to bury the evidence

0,ethic,"3/ Other people also found connections between the 2 projects. We saw that yesterday an article was published that said that we were paid to publish FUD and that we are unethical.

It actually looks like someone paid to make it look as if we were wrong.

https://t.co/T4PXr56HMF https://t.co/ZdkJq5WQE3"
1,ethic,"3/ Decentralization has various advantages, but also specific disadvantages for which the NFT space currently does not have a solution. Anonymous people have less of an incentive (or even no incentive at all) to act morally/ethically and to take accountability for their actions."
2,ethic,"69/ Instead of competing with each other, we hope the NFT space is able to come up with new and innovative self-regulating mechanisms to create an ethical blockchain and ecosystem that doesn‚Äôt reward perverse incentives."
3,ethic,"In a completely unregulated market such as the NFT space, the most immoral and least ethical people always win. They create the ""rules"" that benefit them most. The fact that it's ""decentralized"", makes it even more difficult to see exactly what is going. 

Always remember that!"
4,ethic,"It's a well-known trick if you have been long enough in this space. It's possible that for certain projects (certainly those with unethical people) the ""insiders"" know the metadata before the reveal, so they are able to snap up all the rare items for cheap
https://t.co/8TMBhQn0Ro"
0,tweet,@RogerRa68897399 No. We will tweet about that project and another one (both minting today) soon.
1,tweet,4/4 An example is a team member of a project minting tomorrow using a Twitter account from an attorney (who confirmed he was locked out of his account). 99.99% of the 6400 tweets have no relationship with NFTs. Another example is of an actress whose account now has been restored. https://t.co/f4vpRnYEVZ
2,tweet,"If Twitter is creating a feature that will allow users to edit their tweets, can they also create a feature to show any deleted tweets.

There is often more truth hidden in deleted tweets than in the manipulation and deception found in anything published.

https://t.co/sMmkxchPPH"
3,tweet,"6/ We confirmed Zagabond‚Äôs identity via a couple of different sources: blockchain transactions, comparing his voice with an interview that he did a couple of years ago, and tweets with certain key persons such as Whizwang and certain key timings."
4,tweet,"2/ One of the founders has a Twitter profile with 2900 tweets, but has not tweeted anything for almost 2 years. Another one was involved with the project called PiggybankersNFT, which was a rug. Their Twitter account has been suspended. https://t.co/6vAFC3MWMg"
0,project,"3/ Some claim that this is especially disturbing since a @GalacticApesNFT genesis holder recently offered 200 ETH to buy the project, while it now seems to have been ‚Äúhanded‚Äù over for free. No (proper) explanation has been provided as to why they thought this is a better option."
1,project,"Some people asked us what we think of LuckyLionClub. It's the same spam/scam as all the other 3D NFT projects that we discussed yesterday &amp; the day before. All promoted by ""paid NFT influencers"", that are only interested in 1 thing: $$$. Same applies to BoredGoats and many others https://t.co/0w6K5WaZdP"
2,project,"14/ Before answering that question, we first explain how we were able to discover his identity. We have to go back to a project called Monkey Bet DAO by ‚ÄúInvariant Labs‚Äù (IL) that Beanie says he invested a ""very small"" amount in. That could not be further from the truth. https://t.co/OWDhS4kPk1"
3,project,"6/ It shows that new incentive-based contracts are required. An example could be that 10% of all the mint money goes to the project founders, and 90% to a community wallet. Only after a milestone on the roadmap is met, a percentage of the money will be paid out to the founders."
4,project,"Onboard yourself AND your kids in the #NFT space with PixelSaurus - a family friendly project that's diverse, inclusive and also embraces disability and mental health issues!

0,bad,"5/ And @tailopez, who seems to be much better able to make a fool out himself than we would ever be able to. We thank him for raising so much awareness about bad actors in this space, including himself. https://t.co/ehhYcUET1r"
1,bad,Imagine that anyone in the world forwards you emails from their spam folder and asks you whether that email is legit or not. That is exactly how our inbox looks like. Lots of new people in this space that are not aware that lots of bad actors have joined the NFT space as well.
2,bad,"10/ If this issue is not soon being taken care of, it will only get worse and these nefarious actors only get more influence and become more intertwined with the NFT ecosystem. And one day you wake up and realize Big Tech was not even that bad."
3,bad,"4/ We have thought about some self-regulating mechanisms that will either remove any bad actors completely (and will reduce the value of all their NFT holdings to nearly zero), or ensure they do compensate for their past wrongdoings. How?"
4,bad,"FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out https://t.co/R5eRU4VBXV"
0,rug,"12/ The Azuki core values could in some way not be more ironic: community first (only not the ones that were rugged), dope sh*t only (only not the copypastas that served as ‚Äúlearning experiences‚Äù) and trust the process (don‚Äôt ask any questions, but ‚Äútrust us‚Äù). https://t.co/NUc96VO0bN"
1,rug,"2/ They all mention his connection to the project @HolyCowsNFT, which was a rug by him and he then handed over the project to the community. When checking Yubico‚Äôs Discord ID, it is similar to (at least) two OpenSea profiles which both mention the same Discord ID. https://t.co/lMn2SWAndL"
2,rug,1/ In the past hours we received messages from more than 10 individuals who mentioned that Yubico from CerealClub is a (serial) rugger. We reviewed the evidence and found the allegations credible. We will provide the evidence in the following tweets. https://t.co/SHnEYkjKlw
3,rug,"16/ According to the IMF that provides a conservative estimation that between $600 billion and 1.5 trillion USD of illicit money is laundered, with most drug money going through offhore &amp; lesser regulated jurisdictions such as Paraguay, UAE and even the USA. https://t.co/k5i1kg1gxJ"
4,rug,"Yes, @AB84 is known to promote NFT projects for money and without doing any due diligence. He also tweeted about Vault of Gems, which was a complete scam by the same team that rugged many other projects. 

And then he deletes all tweets from his timeline.
