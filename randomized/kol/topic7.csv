0,let,1/ Tomorrow @0xHustler's project @SavePlanetEarth will be minting. We do not often see individuals that post so many tweets (when he doesn't delete them which he frequently does) which contain so many logical inconsistencies. Let's take a look at only some recent tweets.
1,let,"@NFT_Julius @Obluda777 @SadBotsNFT You have 12.5K followers with 20 tweets. And you deleted all your old tweets. You are probably part of this whole scam factory, no? https://t.co/B9UfAhsHy5"
2,let,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."
3,let,"22/ Transparency pervades all domains and each person will be asked to provide certain basic input such as your wallet addresses, disclosures about (financial) relationships with (past/future) projects, alpha groups and/or other influencers (and their wallets)."
4,let,"This thread is worth a read - many of these scam projects are advertised via Instagram (with fake followers, paid accounts/celebrities, etc.) and the track record is not good: 4 complete rugs and 25 out of 36 projects are at or below the mint price.

https://t.co/asFIFOFxSl https://t.co/HODRXFpgTt"
0,people,"59/ It is ironic that Beanie promotes web3, but in his behavior shows all the signs of the web2 world by censoring, banning and blocking people who voice legitimate concerns over any of his projects."

3,people,"History will judge very hard on big social media influencers on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc., pretending to be reputable and reliable, for selling a young generation of naive and easily influenced people worthless NFTs for tens of millions of dollars."
4,people,"8/ Discord channels and any future minting will be based on a particular TRUSTH threshold, so if your score is too low, you are basically not part of the community and won‚Äôt be eligible for any of the perks that people with a score above the threshold will have."
0,like,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
1,like,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
2,like,"27/ It is ironic that Beanie often mentions his dislike for low-effort copy pastas, when we have to conclude that Monkey Bet DAO and Baboon Bet (1000 ETH mint in total) was nothing more than just that: a copy pasta of RGT‚Äôs earlier products. https://t.co/YHhDc8nukM"
3,like,"5/ He also launched his own CBD coin, with the following mission: ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs first CBD coin that donates CBD products to the less fortunate that can‚Äôt afford natural medicine to treat their ailments.‚Äù A noble cause, just like his ""Save Planet Earth"" venture. https://t.co/tqid8MGks9"
4,like,"All these Web3 influencers that constantly promote scam projects seem to forget that they have become the replacement of the Web2 giants that they all so dislike. 

Their behavior is however infinitely worse and opportunistic than all of BigTech together.

0,ill,"24/ Also remember that if you ever see a tweet from @jf_nft in which he asks which NFT to buy, he is likely buying it with your money that he gained via all kinds of dodgy scams. This whole space is filled with charlatans, and many are high profile names that operate in networks."
1,ill,"24/ Linda Xie is very well connected in the NFT space, is a personal investor in OpenSea, a ""close friend of a16z‚Äù (in a16z‚Äôs own words). Zagabond quit his job at 0x Labs in September and was congratulated on Twitter by Linda Xie and Will Warren. https://t.co/SfDOtnvQ0P"
2,ill,"67/ We urge people with large influence in the NFT space, particularly those who do this anonymously, to behave ethically and remind them that if they don‚Äôt, they will be found (out). Beanie surely agrees given that he ran an online reputation management company https://t.co/ENFfWKkOEN"
3,ill,"9/ The Daily Mail didn‚Äôt publish anything about the restraining order because of that, so if you ever wonder why all these billionaires want to buy media companies (Forbes, Times Magazine, Washington Post, etc.), you now know the answer. https://t.co/m6Q5OgHQs7 https://t.co/Dqlo1CAFuI"
4,ill,"The story about @Farokh &amp; @tailopez is actually worse. Tai was a client of Farokh's company Good Life and he was mentioned on multiple websites as a reference client (just like GaryVee). Tai's name has now been removed, but the screenshots are still there.

2,hope,"@NFTherder We lack the resources/time to check each and every project properly and specifically mentioned NEW people not to mint. Proof is also very hard to find before mint, when it is most urgent to warn people but we see a clear pattern. We hope more people invest time into research."

2,good,@phuktep @JaymesWestfall @DeezeFi @dsphoto1985 This is bullshit. Deeze is one of the good guys and genuinely just loves the banter of collecting NFTs. I'd trust him with my unborn children.
3,good,"1/ Before our upcoming thread about VCs, we thought it would be good to first give some additional background to further understand the context and connections that we will be making. It‚Äôs a simplified version for brevity purposes."
4,good,"20/ When we deal with (anon) people that we only know via digital interactions, we often fill in the things we don‚Äôt know in the most favorable way we imagine. We project our own fantasies to fill in the blanks, which is part of the reason why good people are so often scammed."
0,day,"@NFTherder @youbekindtoday FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Maybe the NFT space could actually use a little bit more of that and use it as an incentive to find mechanisms to get rid of all the bad and nefarious actors in this space. Ironic that we are constantly called out."
1,day,"Unethical transactions on the blockchain are comparable to a stored blood sample from an athlete that used doping. They might think they have gotten away with it but the detection methods are getting better every day, and one day, the sample will be retested &amp; you will be exposed"
2,day,"62/ In the early days of the Larva Labs discord Channel, Beanie has told many things which we have now confirmed to be true. He revealed that he owned a real licensed casino company that was run by Owlman. https://t.co/PBqTZ7iqU4"

Blockchain is becoming widely used technology for systems that require trust, and #TrustVibes applies it. So it issued Trust token, which allows creators to generate revenue in TrustVibes in multiple ways.

0,know,"3/ One profile clearly shows involvement in this project and his real Twitter account is screenshotted below. The reason we know this is that when he handed over the project to the community, people discovered this. https://t.co/JvDzlrchti"
1,know,"22/ There is some overlap with the list that was publicly disclosed that included Steve Aoki and Dez Bryant (they both have also received the Party Round NFT), but we do not know why some of the other individuals on that list didn‚Äôt receive this particular NFT."
2,know,"1. OG crypto and NFT people are paranoid about future ""winters"". This is a cognitive bias; the ""curse of knowledge"". What's different now compared to 2018 is mass adoption, proven concepts, technology and utility. We're not getting another crypto winter."
3,know,"7/ It is equally well-known that big corporations can make deals with many countries that allow them to have more favorable tax rates than the average Joe, and that they use all sorts of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù offshore constructions to minimize tax. https://t.co/xukz4d9qeZ"
4,know,"It's quite shocking, but we have other things to do this weekend than NFT'ing.

We noticed some messages about Pixelmon. It's often quite easy to discover someone's identity. In this case you have to know that the former Twitter handle of Syberer used to be Dippysucks. Good luck."
