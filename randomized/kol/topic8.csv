4,8,minting,It was a brilliant strategy from Yuga Labs. Let all the poor souls sell off their NFTs from other projects so that they could purchase (305) ApeCoin at the top and then create a “high gas” minting process which only the “rich &amp; influential” could afford. Win-win in true VC style.

0,8,trust,"7. If you have problems setting it up or it's not working DO NOT post your problem in a public domain, because 99% of the time it'll get answered by a scammer who'll try to exploit you. Best thing to do is DM someone you trust for support."
1,8,trust,20. Be suspicious of ALL links you click. Best thing to do is have one device for social media etc and one device for just your crypto transactions. Don't trust ANYONE. Remember people are often imposters. Always triple check who you're speaking to. Don't open any files.
2,8,trust,"20/ And he mentions that people especially trusted @NFT because of Mark Cuban’s name on the page and the blue verified account. They tried to remove his name after this scandal came out, but the screenshots were already taken. https://t.co/r1aX2fNcf9"
3,8,trust,"2/2 When confronted with that, he said that his account was hacked by someone else and that he didn't have anything to do with it. In December the kind soul @Zeneca_33 already wrote a thread about him. Shame that a small minority makes us all less trustful https://t.co/EYdquGmTg4"
4,8,trust,6/ Let’s start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how “trustworthy” each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
