3,mint,"6/ We did not create the PDF document that was released, couldn’t edit the document and didn’t have time to create a proper thread in advance of minting. In the end we decided that sharing the info would outweigh the potential downsides of the document and not releasing it."
4,mint,"2/ Via the OpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received “NFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investments”. We confirmed that these are genuine (seed) investors. https://t.co/phDWGuGilG"

0,early,"4/ Our advice in general is: if a project is clearly created for the sole short-term purpose of a money grab/scam, don’t mint. It’s quite easy to see if projects really invested in a long-term roadmap and are open to constructive feedback and transparency."
1,early,"62/ In the early days of the Larva Labs discord Channel, Beanie has told many things which we have now confirmed to be true. He revealed that he owned a real licensed casino company that was run by Owlman. https://t.co/PBqTZ7iqU4"

0,music,"2/ We owe a lot to individual Russian people in terms of science, literature, art, music, etc. Bob Dylan’s paternal grandparents emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the US, one of many examples of brilliant minds that originated from Russia."
1,music,There was a time when everyone in the Web3/crypto/NFT space was supporting each other with a common goal to make this tech more mainstream. But now our paths are diverging and we are all playing musical chairs. It's a beautiful interplay between human cooperation and competition.

4,miss,"38/ The case was however dismissed because Beanie allegedly made a deal and sold out all his thousands of paid customers, incl. admins/mods of his forum by handing over all their personal data to the authorities. They all faced criminal charges and were fined. https://t.co/WBPkeK2mvo"
0,trust,"We were contacted by a member of the community who said they claimed the original account for us, and has since handed over the handle. 
We didn’t trust this right away due to the murkiness of the entire situation."
1,trust,"22/ It’s interesting to realize that the Web2 world has instilled so much trust into the digital world, that scammers are abusing that trust and people are simply handing over their hard-earned money without any hesitation."
2,trust,"5. Undeniably, the artwork of the avatar drop has been one of the “coolest” and most unique to date. Many compared BAYC to Supreme, but I think Azuki to Supreme is a much better comparison. Finally, “trust the process” implies the team knows what they’re doing."
3,trust,"5. I know we're missing punks or AB or more this or more that. If we had infinite money we would collect everything trust me! We've simply picked our favourite stuff, that we view as complementary to the classic Punk/AB construct. You can read more here: https://t.co/OoXqxFqZoz"
4,trust,"10. Why is that bullish for NFTs? Well tokens can act as a gateway for events. Things like VIP benefits, skipping queues (trust me there were a LOT of queues), access to celebrities, limited edition merch..you name it."
0,want,"5/ We have often compared this to spam email. How can you assess whether spam emails are truly spam? Do you have to fly to country XYZ to check if the person exists and has a bank account with $10 million USD that they want to share with you?

2,want,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let’s hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don’t have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else. You might want to review some of your past digital tracks to make that not too easy...
3,want,"2/ “in the interest of TRANSPARENCY, the winners can choose whether or not they wish to be revealed publicly”. Don’t be surprised if the winners don’t want to be revealed and the siblings of the founders are all suddenly driving in lambos. https://t.co/AkqA3OMBWp"
