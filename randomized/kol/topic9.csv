2,club,"@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance It's about creating awareness for potential scams. On the surface most projects look great, but if you go one level deeper or ask a couple of more (difficult) questions, you generally see the true nature of a project."

4,club,@NFTherder @hypebearsclub @cryptocom @binance We simply wanted to make people aware of this fact. We have noticed lots of new people joining this space that are very naive. It is not uncommon for the funds to be distributed to non-anon accounts or accounts with a history. As said - we look forward to seeing what happens.

If they only mint out 10%, it's still an easy $6.5 million.

2,easy,@digitalartchick Thanks. Let’s hope that anonymous influencers in the future will behave in such a way that they don’t have to worry about their safety in case they dox themselves or get doxxed by someone else. You might want to review some of your past digital tracks to make that not too easy...

2,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
3,transparent,@littlelauchie Marketing doesn’t equate to inorganic growth imo - it’s a funny place because it changes so quickly what works one month won’t work the next but as long as you’re authentic and transparent about your practises (ie avoiding paid shills etc) you’re good
