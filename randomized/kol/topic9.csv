0,9,chill,@blawgchain @SuperRareLabs @SuperRare I'm a large holder of $RARE and I'm totally cool with it. I have my full trust in the team and for me that's the biggest reason I haven't sold and actually bought more in addition to my airdrop. I'm happy to just chill and let them take the wheel; interests aligned.

We laughed (and learned) a lot. Thank you.
