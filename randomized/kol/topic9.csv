0,9,transparent,"A lot of what goes into the building an #NFTproject is unsaid and behind the scenes. 

But at Take Up Space we don’t believe in gatekeeping. 

Here’s a bit more of a transparent look at what week 3 in web3 looked like for us. [THREAD] 🧵👇🏽"
1,9,transparent,2/ We provided some info about a good person in the NFT space who is fully doxed and has been fully transparent. And still there was a little skeleton in the closet (not the drugs). You can imagine the graveyards that are hiding behind those that are not doxed and non-transparent
2,9,transparent,"1/ It’s sad to see that the Russian people have so long been represented by leaders that have reflected everything that Web3 doesn’t stand for: repression of (political) opponents, censoring and suppression of the free press and lack of free, fair and transparent elections."
3,9,transparent,"It takes a lot to build an #NFTproject. Most of it happens behind the scenes.

When TUS was born 4 weeks ago, we made a conscious decision to build in public and be transparent.

0,9,platform,"Many of these so-called ""influencers"" that pretend to like Web3 often don't seem to like the transparency which is one of its key characteristics and they love deleting tweets and blocking people. They therefore like all the Web2 platforms that allow them to do that. The irony."

3,9,platform,"1/ A quick update on MontanaBlack who in actual fact seems to have &gt;20 million followers on all kinds of platforms. The story shows how many of these scam rings operate.

4,9,platform,"1/ An interesting story on Squiggles and how one of the largest German social media influencers (&gt;8 million followers across all platforms) was involved. He just ""apologized"" for promoting this scam by three voice tweets. Writing it would probably do more reputational damage. https://t.co/25yQK8cUJf"
