1,1,collector,"As an NFT collector and artist, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs not only about investing in the NFTs themselves, but investing in the good people behind the projects. I thrive on transparency, fun community, and positive vibes. Which communities should I be joining?"
0,1,new,"Calling all #NFT  historians. Although I don't consider @cryptobabypunks a true ""derivative"" (because they created a new pfp from 2 Punks) but bias aside, Can we find out if there were another ""derivative"" before them? March 2021 is birth date."

0,1,work,it‚Äôs no wonder scammy nft projects have resorted to the same bot tactics. I wonder if it actually works or if there needs to be some inherent trust built in before a bot strategy works‚Ä¶it‚Äôs annoying for people actually in the space but to an outsider who doesn‚Äôt know any better?

Life is diverse in its manifestations. Appreciate the moments and find the good in each condition.

0,1,best,"Price, market sentiment &amp; macro factors don't scare the best projects.

They will build relentlessly until goals are achieved and visions are fulfilled. 

NFT gaming hasn't even started.

Place trust in teams who focus on the bigger picture, they are the ones who are truly GMI."
1,1,best,@NFTethics Have you interviewed the @HolyCowsNFT people? Sounds like you said - one founder hung around and tried their best to make it a success and only relinquished ownership to holders when they asked. Sounds like a flop not a rug anyway‚Ä¶
0,1,moral,"vince mcmahoning through ""famine affluence and morality"", ""NFT auction"", ""extreme poverty"" and ""Peter Singer"""
1,1,moral,"@dapppunk All great questions. Unfortunately, I've seen honest polls on nft Twitter where people are clearly here to make money,  even at the expense of others and regardless of the morality behind that profit. I'm super bullish on crypto/nfts but mega bearish on 75%+ of the people"
0,1,space,"I personally think this will be good for the NFT space as it highlights the transparency and shows thats its more difficult to get away with due to the public nature of transactions.

1,1,space,My aim is always to be as transparent as I can while brining value to people in the space. Whether thats sharing other projects (free mints/WLs etc) or just general NFT advice (NO FRANCE) on how to get started. üëá
