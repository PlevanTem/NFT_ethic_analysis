1,new,"Projects with roadmaps and economies like @SewerRats_NFT are equities, they have fundamentals and can be bought as investments. Don't sleep on this new asset class! #SRSC #ratattack #ratpack"
2,new,"I've been given a sneak peek  into the @StrangeCaterNFT Caterpillers NFT. I was shown the sketch of their new banner and now its been completed. Wow! I love how this is all coming along. Shout out to @StrangeCaterNFT for the sneaks, trust, and keeping me in the loop!
LFG!🚀 🚀 https://t.co/4PBvU0w1im"
3,new,"Why would you buy #NFT? It can be an entry to the new digital art market, which is transparent, and which ownership is proven by cryptocurrency and blockchain. But it consumes a lot of energy, explains #HECprof Christophe Spaenjers @CSpaenjers. #HECdataDay21 https://t.co/OJNoqefWpt"
4,new,"In new, rapid-growing financially viable spaces, the application of ethics can often be pushed aside for the sake of profiteering. In the #NFT space, we can and should always strive to be better. Little differences can go a long way. 💚"
0,price,"Things I have observed with strong $EGLD NFT projects;
1. Strong, loyal communities &gt; initial hype
2. Creator is transparent and very active in the community 
3. Generally lower mint prices, community determined their value
4. Creates additional value to holders"
1,price,@crxty12 @BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft What a great decision! I believe that soon next year the collection’s floor price will be 10 ETH. 100% trust in @BAYC2745 and team! Happy New Year PA fam 💎🙌🏼
2,price,"Be careful about unrealistic thinking! “If my token can just get to one penny, I will be a millionaire.” “If the floor price of my NFT gets to 5ETH I’m rich”. “If this happens then that happens”. Be realistic. Trust math. Not hope."
3,price,"NFTs are actually a great showcase for the emptiness of the promise of blockchain transparency. Pages aggregate prices and volume of NFT trades but because there is so much wash trading that data is public, accessible, not faked but also not the truth."

3,mint,"@sovaeth @nalabear18 @EKC_DAO @NFTethics False info. Tendies failed to mint out, holders were raffled Eth. Failed projects aren't rugs.
Phunk/Zunkz are deriv with no roadmap. New Zunkz team made roadmap.
All promises kept. An artist doesn't have to keep adding value to their nfts after they deliver, neither do devs."
4,mint,"Some of you will grind for days just to get a whitelist spot and mint an NFT for 0.05eth just to list the same minute for 0.05eth. You don’t actually know that you are just wasting gas fees unnecessarily. 

why mint in the first place? No single trust in the team. Idiots"

1,invest,"@luart_io @Levana_protocol 
For sure we need investigation in every #NFT project and a transparent mechanism for allocating WL and Mint and assigning rarities. I want to know how many NFTs team keeps for itself, how much does it give back for partnerships what are rarities ❤️‍🩹"
2,invest,@mgxs_gnss Honestly I think one more month can be a good decision to sort the real holders of the project (long term) and the “post-announcement” flippers. But It’s right that 1 month in the NFT space is like 1 year in real life (for the investors). Let’s enjoy the art and trust the process
3,invest,NFT projects that sell equity to investors are Web2 wolves in Web3 sheeps’ clothing.
4,invest,Thankful for the new relationships I’m forging in the NFT space particularly that of my class of 21/22 alumni from the @investingtutor NFT course. I never would’ve anticipated that what would start as a diverse group of people eager to get in on NFTs would become like family. ✨
0,floor,"As a person of color, it pains me to see the floor of EVERY human-based NFT consist of only dark skin faces.

Feels like buying into a constant reminder of Institutional Racism. Respect to the artists for the representation tho. It’s a start 😕"
1,floor,"Benefits of a small supply NFT projects 

Pros
- Controllable floor
- Exclusiveness
- Stronger community
- Diversity in traits

Cons
- Harder to get whitelisted
- Slightly higher floor price"
2,floor,"@Ars0nic @MrsArsonic You know we met because of @framergence so this is obviously bias but if I was trying to be “NFT romantic” and budget wasn’t a problem I would look at 5 floor Frams and help her burn those 5➡️4, 4➡️3, 3➡️2, 2➡️1, and create a memory together beyond just the B-Day “gift.” ❤️🔥🖼❤️ https://t.co/TX7Zbe4z5v"
3,floor,"@mrdawnRR @CosmicCats_ Team is super strong and transparent. Run daily spaces with alpha, vibes, and advice. Sales are consistent and average sale is almost double floor. The community is insane you can barely look at a nft post without seeing a cat. Project is amazing https://t.co/7P0HP72a7l"
4,floor,"@dmoravec @opensea @DecentralGames Right but it’s a snapshot WL so blacklisted &amp; just make new add XDG &amp; wait for next WL.

IP tracker- Use VPN

We’re chasing symptoms, man. Trust me. It’s a root issue that needs to be addressed.

🧐 Transferred NFT cooldown probation &lt;1 month after Mint.

Market determines floor."
0,trust,If you can't see an NFT project lasting over a year without a recognizable brand. Forget the mint and trust your gut. It usually right 😉
1,trust,"@doobie581 @thugbirdz https://t.co/KMGXy2OWoe

if you're already here on twitter at this juncture, trust me, we're just getting started. be careful with scams, follow the right people. few to note are:

2,trust,"@1x1_NFT Panic? F*ck panic. How about angry!
@hicetnunc2000 is the only platform that gave me a viable way of selling my art in the way that I wanted.

4,trust,"I trust and hold many metaverse projects over #Solana NFT ecosystem, but @_portals_  is the king without any doubt. Their numbers are just awesome:

0,project,"@Mezmon1 @osf_nft @beaniemaxi @pixelvault_ @punkscomic Deceiving investors? Owning the NFTs doesn't constitute an equity investment in PV. It has always been known that Beanie fronted money for assets for the vaults, fronted other money for the project since the beginning, and purchased/minted a lot of NFTs."

4,project,"@NFTethics You saying you received 5-10 DMs from anonymous Twitter accounts and then releasing a statement assertively stating it is a rug is wild. Why not say you’ve received multiple DMs and we should exhibit caution, but you can’t confirm nor deny issues with the project?"
0,transparency,Only 20% of the Top 50 Solana NFT projects have doxxed teams. Open ended question: How much do you value transparency and accountability in your NFT collectibles selection? We hope to help increase that number soon. @knox_trades @sainteclectic
1,transparency,"fully transparency about advertisement and creating community engagement by involving every nft holder! that is what the community needs and is cutting edge! @ProximaMTV 

everybody thinking if its worth to hold some so called „floor ships“, the answer is: YES🚀 @MultiVAC_Global"
2,transparency,"@NFT_Nub I’ll be honest. Before I looked into it I assumed they were all fully SC operated DAOs. I just want more transparency of the fact they are not. Since they are not, trust in the team behind them then becomes extremely important."
3,transparency,"@BOBBYBUYCALLS @LilSketchy2 @mongoosecoineth @mongs_nft Fact check: not actually 15k holders most holders sold and have remnant coins too cheap to sell
Fact check: multisig members have not been doxed nor been announced as separate impartial parties to the dev
Don’t be a sheep my fellow mongs Authenticity and transparency are key 
V2!"
4,transparency,"IMHO @ZAGABOND and the other founders of @AzukiOfficial should also doxx themselves. If accountability and transparency means something, this will be the best move to prove their commitment towards the project. #Azuki community should push for this.

Anyone else agree? #NFT #NFTs"
