4,11,mint,Hot take: It really goes to show you how new people are in the NFT space where they are surprised by a discord perms to phish a mint. Crypto has always been like this from hard rugs to soft rugs from day 1. The number one rule is just don't trust anyone online ❤️ Be safe 👊
0,11,dev,Morality is utility. I am so thankful that my first NFT was a @WickedCraniums and we have devs like @WickedDerb and @WickedDoob who stick with the project through thick and thin. #skullsbackskulls

The token still has a low market capitalization ($2.8M) and is currently running to gain volume, and to rank up on the standing.

The developer of this token (see team) is also followed by CZ, which means it is transparent.

The token is already running for a year."

4,11,dev,"This emerging division in media art culture and the use of NFTs feels more than ecology and ethics. I've noticed many NFT haters are white, middle-class, and over 50, and already have well-developed art or academic careers. Worth considering issues on class and age as well here."

2,11,project,"@NFTethics @0xHustler @SavePlanetEarth Nah this ain’t it. First off the man is completely doxxed, this is a non-profit and you’ll be able to see everything on the blockchain. Nitpicking here IMO. Giving the car away is a way to entice and reward people that want to do good within the project. Nothing wrong with that."
3,11,project,"The transparency that some music NFT projects offer for royalty splits (for ex: @soundxyz_ splits), and fast payments via smart contracts will raise people's expectations from trad rights owners.

That's an undeniably positive result, but indeed doesn't solve every problem."

2,11,community,@MingoiaTrevor @NFTethics I totally disagree. This way we are downgraading back to web2. whats the point? any scammer could buy actors to be doxxed for a project and still rug you. I dont think doxxing is necessary at all. trust is made by how nft teams work and interact with their community.
