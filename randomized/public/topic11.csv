1) Have your first nft project be established. Doesn’t have to be blue chip but something that is progressing and is active.

2) Doxxed teams. Transparency is important. 

3)Be ok with it going to $0 😅"

2,project,"5/ The DM Slide

If you engage in NFT communities, at some point you will receive a DM from a seemingly authentic account. Know that it is VERY unlikely for any project to DM you out of the blue.

Only trust accounts that you can trace back to a project’s official links. https://t.co/vAjICfgRbx"

OTC trades remove a key component of the blockchain, transparent data. You're also omitting artist/platform commissions🤬🖕 

If you buy an NFT for 1eth then OTC trade for 10eth, the value last tied to the artwork/nft is still 1 eth. Not 10eth. https://t.co/poJKHAXjHv"

3,transparent,"To be transparent I have a @worldofwomennft NFT myself. Yes, more women are finding their way and voice within NFTs and I think the project helps to further that mission.
