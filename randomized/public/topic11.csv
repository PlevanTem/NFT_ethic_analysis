4,11,mint,"@Libruary_NFT I’ve heard both @mbl267_NFT &amp; @jacksettleman bring up the great points that TS’s transparency is likely ironically hurting them in the short term, because in the card world you have no idea what true mint count or global low ask is, whereas TS gives you complete perfect info."
0,11,dev,"@AkuDreams we paid 2.1e for the nft. Now even you mint that for us, is that worth 2.1e? Nah, because you don't have enough funds to do the future development. Worst decision to trust you. So disappointed"
