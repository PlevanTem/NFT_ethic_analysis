0,12,year,"Some questions to ask founders of NFT projects:

- How much time do you spend daily in your own community?

- How do ensure fairness of the minting and reveal processes?

- Where do you see NFTs 2 years from now and how does your project align with that?"
1,12,year,"I just want to come out ahead of the news from 
@NFTethics...

I smoked A LOT of weed in college. I also once told a fib in an article I wrote many years ago."
0,12,make,"Let’s talk about each of them briefly.

To build credibility: With the increase in NFT scams and rug pulls, upcoming projects need to make people believe and trust them."
1,12,make,@Loopifyyy @NFTethics @moonbirds_xyz How doesnt this point to things? It links wealthy people together into a group that is motivated by obtaining more profit. These groups them use their influence peddling operating to make money for themselves amd eachother. Its always the people minting who lose.

NFTs are created &amp; stored on a blockchain, which means they are secure, transparent &amp; unchangeable. When you purchase an event ticket NFT, you immediately know it’s authenticity."

0,12,community,@MrMaximalist @warpsound_ai I believe @warpsound_ai  has a fair shot at becoming the OG in the AI music NFT segment. We are currently merely scratching the surface in terms of what that even means. The team's creds + transparency + execution against roadmap + non-shill community building is second to none.
