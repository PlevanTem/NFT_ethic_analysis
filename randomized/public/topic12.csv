Projects lack transparency and real value. #FUNS is different. Art is also 🤯🍬

1,12,love,@ilovegarfield69 @Fan26_America @della_morte_ But why would that need to be an nft? How would an nft concert ticket give “equity in the profits of events?” And in what way is that exclusive to it being an nft and not just…a regular ticket or contract?

In a few hrs our lives change!"
2,12,come,"@cryptoShields @NFTethics @jwilliamsnft We actually disagree here, and is why we have fully doxxed our founders. You do have a very significant impact on the statements made about projects. Obviously the work we all do comes with risks, but being doxxed eliminates any concerns about any other intentions"

3,12,year,There hasnt been any accountability in terms of racism toward black people in the overall art world for years. Now that same problem landed in the NFT world. No wonder alot of these folks wanna hide their face on this app

0,12,make,@Vince_Van_Dough @NFTethics @DeezeFi NFT Ethics is still bringing value to the NFT community. They probably should be more selective and get all the low hanging fruit and not reach. Exposing larps and fraudsters is a dirty job that will no doubt make you enemies.

4,12,make,"In NFT land, having a ton of followers doesn’t make you smart, and being rich doesn’t mean you have inside information.

Most of us are either lucky or got in at the right time (also luck).

Always trust yourself over some talking picture on Twitter 😇"
0,12,change,FACT. Any NFT project that you buy in to can change the link that points to your media at any time they choose. UNLESS THEY LOCK THE TOKEN_URI (most don't). We need to demand better &amp; more transparent solutions. Nothing is as decentralized as you think right now. #NFTCommunity
1,12,change,"I have to say that I loved the Xact peer to peer days. 

We made connections more than we made transactions. 

Every exchange required trust and that built trust in the community. 

That period set the tone for the uniquely connected and supportive Hedera NFT space we have today."
2,12,change,This is spot on. Trust me guys I’m saying these things based on my real life experience. I’ve made 50k many times and it hasn’t changed my life once. I’ve also sold a blue chip stock way early and had to live with regret. SR Spiderman is a hold. It’s a million dollar NFT easy.

•Be authentic, be genuine, be transparent.
