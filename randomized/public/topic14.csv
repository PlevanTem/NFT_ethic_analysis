Us, and others, have spotted a worrying trend. Beware the 'Clonetive' projects and invest in real artists who will be happily transparent.

0,like,"the reason artists doing an NFT is so distressing isn’t just the environmental stuff, it’s that they listened (or ignored a chance to listen) to very legitimate criticisms of NFTs and went “but actually I know better/I still want the money”

how can you trust someone like that?"
1,like,"I think moonbirds keep trending up until copers drop the bias and fomo in

The web2 old money that just entered likely don’t have to many other nft bags and I could see profits flowing back into other “blue chips”
