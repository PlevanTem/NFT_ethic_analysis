but sweep a NFT floor, pump the shit out of it, try to meme it into relevance,

1. A smooth mint is very very important to gain the investors trust.
2. Don‚Äôt get too attached to a project.
3. If you have low liquidity sell even at a loss and move one.
4. There are multiple new good potential projects launching everyday.
