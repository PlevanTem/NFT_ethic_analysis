0,15,trust,I couldn’t close a deal on a NFT today bc I don’t trust founders and devs to be great capital allocators. 2022 is the year of good management teams that use capital to grow their project. A few examples are @LazyLionsNFT @psychedelic_nft @NFTCryptoChicks @GutterCatGang #NFTs

Click on the @Collab_Land_ bot from a Discord Server you trust and add the following note (red box).

You should do this same thing for the Team, Mods, Devs, etc. so that you can know you are talking to the real person and not an imposter.

1. The art and the game played with unique traits
2. The transparency along with @BAYC2745’s ability to adapt
3. The community; very welcoming and wise

Your turn, tweet how @psychedelic_nft is driving value in the #NFT space!"

And as always smile it’s infectious, the world will smile back 😊😊

Have an amazing day 🤩🤩🤩"
4,15,day,"@NFTethics From the view of stakers, which many token claimers (free airdrop or publicly bought on UniSwap) participated in, it is genius - it funneled profits directly to the staking community, which if you were staked from day one, currently represents around +130% profit on wETH alone"
0,15,word,"@willquinnart hey do u recognize an NFT resale pockets u more income on that same piece of art? its built into whats called a smart contract, it eliminates u needing to trust peoples “word”. if u sell me a comm. pc for $1000, and i resell it for $5000, u get $0 of that $5000 in 100/100 cases."
1,15,word,"@owneveryword This is genuinely one of the best #NFt Projects out there. You guys have been transparent, brought laughter to the #WordHerd and continue to push for the future of the community. You're killing it, and we appreciate it."
2,15,word,"Two things can be true simultaneously:

@NFTethics is horribly disgusting in how they word their tweets and seemingly hate the concept of anyone making money.

@NFTethics occasionally provides actually useful information that shouldn’t be ignored or laughed at."
3,15,word,"@DataNFT_ @psychedelic_nft leadership, creativity, transparency, professionalism, utility and community all impeccable.

These are not just a collection of buzz words. IMO I see PA as the next big project in this space. 

In volt we trust."
4,15,word,@mbhdoteth @NFTethics the most alarming part of that thread was that they had never heard of the word cowabunga.

1,15,space,@hunterorrell it was beautiful. clear that people need more explained. nfts are entry to art for many in the space - art literacy isn’t high. add money and fear to the mix and people run easily. hoping this lands creatures in the hands of diverse and interested art buyers.
