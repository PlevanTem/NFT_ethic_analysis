2,16,okay,"I don't care about the bias you have against okay bears but this is bullish for the Solana NFT  ecosystem and that's a Win.

Hopefully this becomes the norm for Solana NFT projects. https://t.co/D9BS2zTB0Z"
3,16,okay,"@NFVault Its okay, we're all humans afterall. Everyone makes mistakes. The best kind are the ones who are transparent about their mistakes. Also, Arvind is still gonna end up with an NFT, I know for sure you guys won't disappoint him and as for the scammer, may God knock some sense."

2,16,mint,@Rig0rNFT @DegenDAOO Hey look the guy made about 20x what we did off the mint. It‚Äôs almost like he ran the drop. Trust me I want vengeance. But what I don‚Äôt want to do is start a trend of NFT owners bricking NFTs as a kind of vengeance against those they have perceived to have wronged them.
3,16,mint,@kashviETH Misogyny/racism is the reason I think a lot of very promising women and minority led projects don‚Äôt mint out. I‚Äôd LOVE a social experiment where a women led team pretends to be guys and make some random NFT to then switch the NFTs to female/non-binary PFP after awhile.

1,16,people,"@albinokid @albinokid the people telling you to trust NFTs obviously have a financial steak in their use. Don't fall for their NFT ponsi schemes. They rely on Crypto currency that must be mined, which eats up power on an unbelievable scale resulting in MASSIVE amounts of coal/oil power use."
2,16,people,One of the most important things to look at in the NFT space is leadership. Investing in leaders is the most important part. The leaders are people you need to trust.

4,16,bad,"In the months since, I've seen artists I've respected FOR YEARS, with a lot more talent than me write twitter threads like ""Trust me, soon there won't be money there will only be NFT."" and ""All the bad stuff is true, but consider how much fun we're having in the NFT community."""
0,16,trust,"Imagine calling deeds of trust or certificates of authenticity a scam. A NFT is literally just decentralized digital proof of ownership via a token on a blockchain.
