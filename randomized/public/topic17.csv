1,time,"@ElderscrollsUTT @scottishchee @stalker_thegame just because ""number go very high"" doesn't mean that NFT's are a successful, ethical, or worthwile to invest in. 12 super rich nerds passing money between each other (and sometimes themselves) doesn't account for the countless people losing money on what they hope will pop off."

4,piece,@NFTethics So all I got from this thread is Zaga is a beast who is extremely legitimate and you guys are pieces of shit for doxxing someone against their will. Also every time you mention VCs you frame it as if there’s some conspiracy?? What’s that about

Having both low cost &amp; low volume of artwork, if I go with eth = high gas, and with polygon = lower collector trust/ratio.
