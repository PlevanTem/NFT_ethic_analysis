1,community,"NFT Community Level:
1. Tribe : before minting, no governance/DAO, centralized leadership to the dev/team.
2. Guild : governance/DAO, voting mechanism, transparent community wallet/treasury.
3. City : issuing a token as currency.
4. Nation : having many cities."

1,user,Reddit hating NFT’s is unfortunate because BAYC seems to be showing that it’s plausible for them to be used to allow users of communities some pseudo equity for their contributions

4,user,"@VeveFA041 @VeveMastermind @reverendalexg @veve_official Faster yes. We need ownership. Tjis is such a no-go.

If someone use bots than it shoult be too late anyway if a NFT was assigned to one bot user.

There problem. Not ours. We need ownership. Trust comes by ownership not by previleges."
0,fuck,@NFTethics I might actually buy an @AzukiOfficial  now. The fuck. Thanks NFT ethics
1,fuck,@veve_official I been trying to get one all week! Just bought more Ruby just to get one! If I get stuck with 333 rubies and no fucking items this is a scam  that was successful in locking in my money! Not on blockchain! Not an NFT YET! I want more transparency! Show me the wallets!

3,fuck,"As I log into fiverr and the first thing I see is them pushing me on NFT’s and, fuck, we’re already in the “there is no ethical consumption under cryptocurrency” phase of this dystopia aren’t we?"
4,fuck,"for the record i am very anti nft for various reasons (environmental, ethical, it's fucking stupid) but i will be ... looking out for what they have to say. bcs this is truly interesting"
0,fair,@dearearth_ My strategy from early to mid 2021 was to go hard and get exposure to almost everything that was being minted. Have had my fair share of Ls too. But once you have a diverse enough portfolio it makes it so much easier to hold. Very bullish on the NFT space as a whole long-term.
1,fair,"We knew that the WSD concept and artistry was going to be unique to the #NFT Space. But the foundation of all their future utility – companions, upgrades, token ecosystem, DAO, and more – should be built around transparency and verifiable #fairness at its core."
2,fair,"11/ It’s very important to us that FTX NFT’s fee structure is fair, transparent, and takes the experiences of NFT artists, buyers, and sellers into account. We’d appreciate your feedback on these questions!"
3,fair,"Little by little, of course, not like a fairy tale, but still! I continue to work on the project. Thank you for your trust. 🐻

0,transparent,@NFTethics @yugalabs 2/ transparent about who is invested. That is all. Interpretation is up to you. That's how valuable journalism works.
1,transparent,"There is a problem with lack of transparency in NFT space. Very few projects communicate clearly what they plan to, how and by when. You cannot claim to be truly decentralized till information dissemination becomes more transparent"

Second, the thread is all public data. To the extent that the thread is doxing (which is unlikely), I align with @NFTethics that “a legitimate interest to dox someone” exists when done to indicate possible criminal acts or prevent fraud: https://t.co/r8JhCBio31"
2,data,"@MagicEden_NFT @zhouzhuojie Nice, but moar data pls! Session length, DAU/MAU, mints per minter, new uniques vs returners, etc. Love the transparency, want so much moar of it!"
3,data,"simply, NFT's are data containers and are a great path for self-sovereign user data handling - transparency, user control, and especially the ability for business to create incentives to access user data in a flexible way is where internet-based data is going."
4,data,"@ComicsandCrypto @DCComics @Todd_McFarlane @veve_official We dont need nobody to publicly confirm anything. In the crypto/NFT space u don't 'trust' but u verify. That's the whole point of the blockchain.

On chain is where the data is."
