3,18,community,Really concerned about a self-proclaimed metaverse project that uses big brand names to promote their upcoming NFT drop but are not active in #Decentraland. We might have to warn the community if they are not more transparent. Don't want this awesome space get hurt. #soonMoreInfo

@NFTethics

you fucked up"
1,18,fuck,@NFTethics The team “decides” to move forward ? Of course they do since they will continue making money of someone else’s art and this person who stole the art doesn’t give a flying fuck because if he/she/they did give a fuck they would come up with a half ass story excusing them selves.
2,18,fuck,"Give a nod to artists putting blood, sweat, and tears into their work. Even if you don't have the means to go in on their project, always feel free to let them know ""Hey. I see you. You're fucking amazing."" It goes a long way. Trust me. #NFT #NFTartists"
3,18,fuck,"To be absolutely clear I have nothing against NFT's as long as

1: They don't help fuck the environment
2: Photogs who can't afford it aren't persuaded to pay for their creation BEFORE the point of sale. 

When it comes to 2 there is imho a moral duty to speak up."
4,18,fuck,"The Treasury minting an NFT? This should be a moral outrage, but it's not even on BBC News's site. COVID rates? Nobody fucking mentions it, but I sure as hell hear about offers on holidays abroad. Or back in games, hey, when is a site going to mention the gender pay gap reports?"

its because influencers wanted to pump that project. they got 5 whitelists and they intentionally caused the fomo. then caused a gas war for only the whales to win after that whitelist bs.

1,18,data,"Here comes the #Web3 question:

Do you trust the app (media player) to render an NFT that you own?

Will the app vendor leak your data?

Will the vendor draw it as a crap?

Will a different vendor try to render your NFT?

If you don’t own code, you don’t really own data.

Agree?"

0,18,way,@alexbreakline @LoadedLions_CDC @cryptocomnft @JoeConyers @DamianSpriggs I am disappointed tbh. I mean they move way too slow. As if they don’t understand the nft space. So far zero benefits from holding a lion imo. They give away 3 vip experiences but with only $1000 dollar travel budget 🤷🏽 I still trust the will do better. But need to step it up
1,18,way,"I'm not going to ask you to trust the new Community Manager. Trust is earned, always.

But there are ways to withhold trust from a company rep that *aren't* threats, ddoses, and doxxes.
