If someone use bots than it shoult be too late anyway if a NFT was assigned to one bot user.

There problem. Not ours. We need ownership. Trust comes by ownership not by previleges."

1,18,fuck,"This whole @NFTethics doxx thread is a series of disconnected trivia about Zaga and some people he’s friends with.

Time to leave this guy and his friends/family alone. If you want to take action and protest, don’t buy Azuki. 

Beyond that, just move the fuck on."

2 - for those thinking it should take shorter, remember this is a new team (and prob only 4-5 devs), from scratch w/ zero infra. I get that adds time ⏲
3 - adding the caps resolves my concerns; I’m in favor 🎉"
