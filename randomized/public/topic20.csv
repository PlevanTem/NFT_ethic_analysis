1,talk,"In NFT land, having a ton of followers doesn‚Äôt make you smart, and being rich doesn‚Äôt mean you have inside information.

Most of us are either lucky or got in at the right time (also luck).

Always trust yourself over some talking picture on Twitter üòá"

Enter the NFT world 1 month ago. Was not prepared at all for what I found.

3,people,Why today during the week of nft nyc  are we seeing a lot of racism come out in the community. We‚Äôre not built around this. It serves no purpose in what we‚Äôre trying to build around what NFTs represents. Let‚Äôs not lower ourselves and look ignorant to people entering the space.
4,people,"@yachtlifebayc @azfnft She might very well be American but quite honestly, a huge # of NFT and crypto investors aren't American. So as long as you don't touch Nike shares, plenty of people would make bank and not have to even worry about it. 

Apart from the optics and questionable ethics of course."
