I notice more and more unethical behavior in our beloved CNFT universe. A thread. What did I miss?

Let us establish #CNFTethics. Let us point out unethical behavior.

3,20,talk,My Discord: 1:5 ratio of Twitter raids and bots DMing me “bonus mints.” My Twitter DMs: 1:10 ratio of me talking to my online friends vs anon NFT shills. My email: 1:2 ratio of recruiters vs Norton antivirus scammer that “accidentally” charged me. This is why I have trust issues.
