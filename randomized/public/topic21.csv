0,21,value,"What we value:

First and foremost, transparency, collaboration, and collective benefits over individual greed.

We want to build an NFT project that is BACKED by real assets, such as the mega-ships being sold by @staratlas, or amazing 1/1 works of art from key artists. https://t.co/pRcQfPck2w"
1,21,value,"OpenSea: Broken, arbitrary, monopoly.

LooksRare: Encourages scams, art theft, washtrading.

We need an NFT marketplace that works but embraces ethical values.

There are a few potential candidates, I hope they don't fall into ""web3 means art theft is OK"" trap."

0,21,investment,"Confirmation bias can easily fuck up your NFT investments. Self-awareness fixes it.

Confirmation bias: the tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values."
1,21,investment,I've decided to rise my #hicetnunc NFT prices just a little. I see how it kind of slowed down my sales but I think as long as I keep my prices lower than what they worth (at least for me) the collectors can't trust me with an investment.
0,21,market,"This is why NFT's are ethical and paywalled subscriptions, etc are inethical; former is a legitimately scarce asset valued in a fair &amp; open market, latter valued only by extortion from threatening state legal action exploiting a corrupt &amp; unjustifiable distortion of copyright law"
1,21,market,"Web3/crypto/Blockchain is a garbage fire. But the NFT space is the worst of the worst. It's all scams and influencer marketing. There is literally nothing there but betrayal. 

Crypto people love lack of trust and if there is one such space in the world it's the NFT domain."
