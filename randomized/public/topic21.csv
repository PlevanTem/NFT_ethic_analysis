2,21,ownership,"interesting discussion around ownership and IP currently in the NFT space.

I doubt that there is actually any legal way right now to transfer actual IP ownership to a digital token =&gt; the only thing you have is a token and for everything else you still need to trust the creator."
3,21,ownership,"@KaeJhee @EFF @tungstencubenft If this is where you preach to me about proof of stake pleas know that I firmly believe all of it is a scam, all NFT owners are bastards, and trying to find an ethical pathway through bitcoin ownership and NFT creation is harder than shoving a camel through the eye of a needle."
