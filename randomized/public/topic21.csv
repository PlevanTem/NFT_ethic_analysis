3,blockchain,"In short, an NFT is a piece of data stored on a blockchain.

Why the blockchain ?

The blockchain makes sure that the information can’t be tampered and provides transparency by keeping track of the previous and current owners. https://t.co/gBt03lYefC"

0,ownership,"@sxtvik You aren’t paying $3 to prove you have ownership of an nft.

You are paying $3 so others can be lazy and trust that you own that #NFT

From Luigi’s perspective it’s a service your paying to provide to others vs yourself."
1,ownership,"The ""NFT"" monicker has been co-opted in the recent year and now elicits to notions of overly simple jpegs and transparent money grabs.

It detracts from the original ideals of co-creation and community-ownership.

Maybe this can be ""NFTs 2.0"""
2,ownership,"@ercwl someone says NFT, I say ""yeah they used to be called colored coins, they ultimately reduce to a trust-based ownership system""

someone says metaverse, I say ""that's not a new concept either, digital emphasis has been growing for a couple of decades (but FB sux)""

Bitcoin = 🤯👌🔥"
3,ownership,"I asked several non-technical people what was their favorite Web3 concept and majority of them said: DAO.

- shared ownership
- easy payments
- improved governance
- actual transparency
- reduced collaboration friction

I am surprised - would have bet crypto/NFT. But DAO!

Nice💯"

3,value,"5- NFT investments are not like cryto investments. The value of a collection is realized over time, just as some values are realized late in art in real life. So leave your investor logic aside from NFT and invest in collections that you really like and trust. #NFTinvestor"
4,value,"1/ Dearest Degens,

As the NFT market matures, what we value as utility will become less important. In the future, the concept of utility will be so diverse &amp; far reaching that it will be unrecognizable by today’s standards.

We degens are a dying breed. 

Yet, there is hope.
