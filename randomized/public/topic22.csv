I made my third sales yesterday and as promised, I collected these two great pieces from @zehra5li and @deryabalkannft 

I spent more than I earned with gas fees, but that's exactly why I trust NFT. The more you give, the more you get.

Let go of the past, for yesterday is dust
Do not trust the future, for tomorrow is illusion
Seize the day and live in this moment
For there is only NOW.
So treasure this REAL PRESENT.
Live in the Dream.
