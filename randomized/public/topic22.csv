Actually the num of request yesterday overload the queue in the network itself, meaning that the same would happened in Trust Market for sure. Is better if we try to fix this problems as a community"

1,22,track,An invaluable lesson I've learned in these few short months in the #NFT space is to trust my instincts...my move on #TeddyTroops has helped affirm I'm on the right track..so psyched right now
2,22,track,"@sheslaurenlee Wrong dear.  You can fail in NFT land if you do it with grace and transparency.  Fail in secret, rug, hide your tracks and people aren’t going to want to invest in you or your stuff."
3,22,track,"I see people FOMO into NFT games + ""Metaverses"" that have no gameplay footage prior and after the mint. 

Ask yourself; ""Will the game be here in 3 years and currently warrants paying $1200. Or, to blindly trust devs with little to no track record in the space."" 

DYOR and GL"
4,22,track,"Trying to keep track of NFT projects by staying as active as possible in Twitter, Discord, and Telegram is not how we should be discovering NFT projects.

It creates way too much bias for factors that do not matter…like influencers who don’t establish a track record."

Crypto is big and scary and your auntie is worried she'll lose all her money when her wallet is hacked.

Decentralization at the base layer of DeFi, NFT, or anything else for that matter – is a requirement for true equality, security, neutrality, transparency, &amp; so on.

1,22,smart,"Number one piece if advice for people entering the #NFT game. Especially on #Solana
Don't buy jack shit you saw on tiktok or YouTube. Hardly anything on Twitter. Find a group of smart people you trust. Listen to them. Then do research."
2,22,smart,"Why @beaniemaxi is not @NFTethics or @digitalartchick or playing any super-clever big 🧠 game like this:

Because scammers might be short-term smart but they're all fucking idiots at the end of the day.

Don't bet on them doing sth clever.

They're just good at playing your FOMO."
3,22,smart,"Some folks have proof of stake, others a better proof of work, proof of some...
