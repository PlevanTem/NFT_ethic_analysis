4,time,"Best advice I can give to someone getting into NFTs: 

Don't trust influencers/big accounts. 

If you do, wait a bit. Watch how they comport themselves over time, what they say.

DYOR applies to people just as much as it does projects.

My favorite aspect of this derivative is the color selection‚Äîso diverse yet effectively used! The ethereal-aquatic portrayal of the Azuki with her nonchalant focus was quite interesting, and I think this rendition was overall very well done!

There is NFT influencers that simply don‚Äôt think of it like this and don‚Äôt mind buying, tweeting, and selling all in the same short time period. Is it fair or ethical? I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes their followers make money and sometimes they lose."

-engage with your community, dont just purely shill; imho new creator like @catverses can be your reference

1,bro,"@NFTethics So they didn't sell a single NFT, just grinders complaining? Come on bro this ain't an ""ethical"" issue at all. 

Projects abort pre-launch all the time for all kinds of reasons. If they sold a bunch of NFTs then called it quits that's one thing. This is a nothing burger"
