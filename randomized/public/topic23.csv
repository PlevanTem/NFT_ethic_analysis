2,23,time,"the reality is community is extremely hard to build because...

📉 teams underestimate how much work &amp; time they required
🤝 building trust requires time but takes seconds to lose 
🙌 teams lack the intentionality to craft community from day one"
3,23,time,"Transparency from the team is one of the most important things you can have in the NFT space, as many teams lack it. Ensuring the community is comfortable/trust the team they are investing their money/time into is really important.

4,23,time,"The NFT space has to get over this selling out an NFT mint in 24 hours. That's where rugpullers want to live, and people that don't want to work hard want you to buy. Real things take time to build trust and a foundation, hype and fomo are marketing tricks! But it's your money..."
0,23,stop,@sophia_wils @mast_iz @NicoleBehnam @APEX_HUNTER_NFT This is another scam. Trust me. They just got me yesterday. Blocked me once they had the money for ‘mining the contract’. It just doesn’t stop. Unbelievable
