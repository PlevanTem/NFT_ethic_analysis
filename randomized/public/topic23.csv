I'm literally judged by my skin color every time i walk outside."
1,23,time,"Important note for the sake of transparency: 
I'm pro web3 and the interesting things we'll build. I'm excited about NFTs as data structures, but not about NFTs in their current limbic &amp; exploitative incarnation.

I shit on NFT projects in my timeline. Make products not hype"

I'm off to share some time with the elephants this week again. I'm selling elephant #nfts to raise funds for their ethical care.

Thanks for being in the space &amp; letting me in
Thanks for being transparent &amp; spend time sharing your craft &amp; personal journey
Thanks for being vulnerable &amp; showing everybody that empathy MATTERS
Thank YOU

4,23,time,"@valwithcatalyst @LeaderSpac @johnm0 They just reported - see the updated models!  And you are right, but that doesn’t mean they need to issue dilutive equity today or tomorrow maybe shares rocket and they issue higher - timeframes matter!  Also, NFT talk and the shares soar-Roth ain’t dumb"
0,23,stop,"I feel like this may be one of the most underrated nft projects rn on solana. These sales are happening and just flying under the radar while @DeGodsNFT and @MonkeDAO are stealing the spotlight (rightly so in fairness) but c'mon, stop posting 'what project should I sweep...' https://t.co/2l0eM0myH2"
1,23,stop,"Amplify the voices in the space that speak truth out loud, even when it's counter to their personal interest.

Ethics matter, stop thinking of the rest of your community as exit liquidity.

2,23,stop,"9/ Another theme that stands out to me is this...

Inclusion, diversity, equity, and access are all at play here in the NFT space.

If ""Zero Art Background"" Mike can create a piece of art on my iPhone that ends up displayed in a prominent gallery what's stopping you?"
3,23,stop,"I wonder how women wants equality and all they could bring to the table is s*x and nudity.

They objectify themselves a lot on all platforms instagram,Twitter,TikTok and even in work place,now they are bringing it to the NFT space🤦‍♂️

Pls u people should just stop already"

1. @ExpansionPunks for the purpose
2. @0xApes_NFT for the experience 
3. @NFTCryptoChicks for the leaders
4. @EtherealApes for the art
5. @RugRadio for the vision

*Not finance advice. Not a promoter*"
1,23,favorite,My favorite things about this great @psychedelic_nft by @BAYC2745 is the transparency it delivers to holders including financials on a quarterly basis and the whole legal process (so essential) and of course the dope roadmap  on its way. Proud to participate. LFG🚀🔥 https://t.co/1DtbmDxEJT
2,23,favorite,I grabbed another 60 Baby Alien Division NFTs. Here are some of my favorites from that batch! NFA but I don't drop 30k cro on mints in 12 hours if I didn't trust the project. Also after mint out they will airdrop a spaceship for each 3 alien nfts and that's only the beginning! https://t.co/ovmhcnCOeQ

1,23,mind,"@VeveFA041 @VeveMastermind @reverendalexg @veve_official Faster yes. We need ownership. Tjis is such a no-go.

If someone use bots than it shoult be too late anyway if a NFT was assigned to one bot user.

There problem. Not ours. We need ownership. Trust comes by ownership not by previleges."
2,23,mind,Each day I am reminded that the caliber of people who make up the #NFT community is unmatched. The incredible level of trust we hold ourselves to during peer-to-peer trades will be studied years from now.
3,23,mind,"Strong, diverse, mindful and equal. Some of the many qualities we all share within this space as women and men 💚✨🌍

As in diversity of NFT peeps 

The BAYC community has converted:
🔹Whales (@dingalingts)
🔹New Wave (@nbatopshot ppl)
🔹Old school ETH heads (@beaniemaxi @DeezeFi)

What other projects can say that?

Also this @TheSandboxGame map🗺️ blows my mind https://t.co/o6K54ajHmy"
0,23,bro,"@GMEshortsqueeze There is a rumor of a couple of innovation funds taking small positions ahead of the NFT marketplace. There is also speculation that some funds are recalling shares. So far it's all ""trust me bro, my cousin's girlfriend's dad works for Goldman"""
1,23,bro,"@htbroekphoto @HuobiGlobal @GetProtocol Best NFT use case to date. 

Solves a lot of ticketing industry pain points, from lack of transparency and trust to ticket fraud and lack of control over secondary market."
2,23,bro,@SharkBrosNFT community was epic for a while. Unfortunately the leader (Abs) of the project has started to threaten mods and users for listing their nfts 🙈. He can also remove the nfts from your wallet 🤯 don't trust sharkbros. #SolanaNFTs #sol #solana #DAO #NFT #NFTCommunity https://t.co/w68BgPq7eF

but you don't own any because instead, you were like :mmm, let me play passive.:

if what stillness has taught me, is to trust my intuition."
4,23,like,Hard to trust new #NFT projects anymore. Kind of happy with what I'm in and being super picky with anything new I'm pickin up. With that said... minting some @OnBoard_NFT looks like it was a good move. Got 3 bangers and originally wanted to flip but now I'm conflicted bc they 🔥
0,23,buy,"Armys are responsible for more than half of hybe's profit. So you can change the game easily. Don't give attention, don't buy, don't support the nft thing. They'll quickly realize the unwanted-ness of it. It's that simple! 
In the meantime, SUPPORT, TRUST, STREAM BTS."

2,23,buy,"Dinguses on the left spend their progressive causes as currency to buy moral offsets the way NFT collectors buy carbon offsets.

I regret to inform you that being anti-fascist doesn't balance out you being a raging transphobe. Nothing offsets bigotry."
3,23,buy,I think I may trust free mint NFT's more than ones with a buy in price. Seems like less chance of a rug pull.
