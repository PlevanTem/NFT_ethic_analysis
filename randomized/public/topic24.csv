1,24,world,@NFTupdate Diversity in leadership positions. Mods getting financially compensated for their hard work. Utilities that I can use in the real world. Projects really rewarding genuine supporters with WL because grinding is stressful.
2,24,world,@robertoblake @nerdcity Yo the ONLY nft project I kinda trust is them right now. People really forget how important a content creators reputation factors into making a project like this and I been excited to see if this one actual does well b/c it mean the world to everyone who does NFTs after them.

1 - Create a world, a story, a life via your #NFTs
2 - Derivate from famous or go wild; wild is where big money is
2 - A business model
3 - Aggressive Roadmap
4 - A marketing plan
5 - Be transparent

I see how there is a need of someone you can trust in this space full of scams and exploit. We need to speak up and help each other!"

4,24,space,"IMO ethics lost a battle today.

""Historical NFTs"" are 💯 tainted.

It'll be an uphill effort to adopt ""Vintage NFT"" term. 2021 moonbois already started co-opting that too..

Big influencers want to reward empty narratives instead of boundary pushers. Bad for the entire space."
0,24,collection,You have to trust Twitter to honor the on-chain NFT registries and wait for them to support each collection. Decentralized social media will do the ownership verification on-chain and support anything that follows a standard (ex ERC-721). @DistriktApp @DscvrO
