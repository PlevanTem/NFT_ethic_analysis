2,24,world,@robertoblake @nerdcity Yo the ONLY nft project I kinda trust is them right now. People really forget how important a content creators reputation factors into making a project like this and I been excited to see if this one actual does well b/c it mean the world to everyone who does NFTs after them.

5 - Be transparent

""Historical NFTs"" are üíØ tainted.

It'll be an uphill effort to adopt ""Vintage NFT"" term. 2021 moonbois already started co-opting that too..

Big influencers want to reward empty narratives instead of boundary pushers. Bad for the entire space."
0,24,collection,You have to trust Twitter to honor the on-chain NFT registries and wait for them to support each collection. Decentralized social media will do the ownership verification on-chain and support anything that follows a standard (ex ERC-721). @DistriktApp @DscvrO
