0,team,@0xCY_ @MagicEden_NFT Give them credit where credit is due. They just turned five months old and have a fantastic team that cares about their users. They’re transparent with us and are always on top of updates and reach out to their audience for constructive feedback and criticism. Be grateful 🤙🏻
1,team,"The team have a good understanding on how web3 should be utilized. NFT it’s not just a jpeg with some cool art. NFT, blockchains will make a big impact in the real world. We are only focusing at the tip of the iceberg..have the trust. You’re investing in the team @CBCreepz"
2,team,"The @thelonelyaliens AMA was one of the most honest and transparent AMA’s I’ve been to.

You can truly tell they value the project and the people over anything else.

Well done @thelonelyaliens team."

3,nft,"It doesn't happen a lot when the price after a reveal goes up.

When this happens it means people really love the art, the rarity aspect, the diversity of traits and so on.

Congrats @osf_nft on achieving that! https://t.co/fIDviQWq4O"

1,transparency,"Quick thread on personal transparency! 

I’ve been under contract with three different NFT projects- @BYOPills, @WillowKings, and @chibiNFT. BYOP and the Chibis were both smashing successes each selling out within 24 hours of launching. To date, the Wizard Festival has &lt;300 mints"
2,transparency,"With how important women are in the space, everyone really, when Fame Lady launched and they didn’t reveal who they are, I passed. One would think pride alone would be enough reason. I know crypto is cool anon but these collectible projects deserve transparency. That’s all. #NFT"
3,transparency,"I was working with the team as a mod, and was in contact with one of the founders as recent as an hour ago. 

In the interest of transparency, I was airdropped a Wavezzz NFT for my services. I was not paid a single cent."
4,transparency,"@Libruary_NFT I’ve heard both @mbl267_NFT &amp; @jacksettleman bring up the great points that TS’s transparency is likely ironically hurting them in the short term, because in the card world you have no idea what true mint count or global low ask is, whereas TS gives you complete perfect info."
0,stay,"@ArtHouseGarbage @zachxbt is actually so much better at uncovering ethical issues compared to NFT Ethics. Perhaps because NFT Ethics built a reputation uncovering ethical issues (and also reflected in the name), they are under pressure to clutch at straws to stay relevant."

As usual, we'll stay transparent. Team was NOT prepared for such a day, and some of you encountered unhandled issues. ☕️

I feel that if this happen to be confirmed that would be a hard hit to #Solana NFT ecosystem

4,project,"... Even if you trust a project, USE A BURNER. I know people who have had their wallet drained of 100s of $SOL. It's never worth the risk. Transfer the $SOL required for the mint to the burner wallet, and use the burner wallet every mint.

0,discord,"Common characteristics (🚩) of projects whose discords grow WAY TOO QUICK (100k-250k in &lt; 1 week):
- minimal community building
- half baked roadmap
- uninvolved founders
- lack of transparency 
- high mint price
- buzzword name drops (metaverse)
- inactive voice chats
