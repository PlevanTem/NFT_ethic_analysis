THE METRICS

The blockchain is transparent, and the blockchain doesn’t lie. Thus, it’s crucial to examine the supply and demand of an NFT project through data, found entirely on-chain."
1,26,supply,"I think a supply increase can be the most damaging utility to an NFT project if not done correctly.

With the addition of breeding, VX’s etc, it can damage the supply &amp; demand metric if there is not enough brand equity.

We see so many older projects that have made this mistake."
