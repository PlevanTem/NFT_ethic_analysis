0,27,good,"A lot of people in this #NFTCommunity are really interessting and talented. Just amazing! ❤

But there are also a lot of people claiming to be good and sometimes maybe offer their help just to betray you later.

Be careful! Don't trust everybody..

1,27,good,When @Maximus_NFT shared this Alpha the floor was 0.02 ETH. I got some immediately because I trust his study. I trust the people's judgement when they put some hard work and little smart work behind their sharing. He is a good friend &amp; I know his sharing are organic no promotion.

3,27,good,"@MikeMcDonald89 NFT panic is similar to gambling moral, except it's constantly being advertised online and on TV, which is annoying for any product.

This is a good skeptical, non-hysterical take about Web3 in general from Max Read. That probably tracks with a lot of normie non-gamblers https://t.co/89lzgoORHS"
4,27,good,"@NFTethics You are doing a lot of great work that is much needed in this space. I was critical of some recent posts because i felt like they were not held to the same high standard of earlier posts. I understand that it’s a tough job, but I think quality over quantity is a good strategy."

6529 Museum: I am the collector, the goal is permanence, broad focus, including emerging artists

6529 NFT Fund: Collecting team decides, long-term hold (maybe permanence), ""blue chip"" focus"
0,27,really,"The whole family is together!😍 I really wonder what lovely baby ape they will produce🥳 @BASCC_NFT thank you for restoring my trust in NFT projects again! 

After getting rugged so many times it's amazing to see transparent and honest devs - always in touch with the community!🙌 https://t.co/kfK4uLiaMT"
1,27,really,"@NFTethics You're a tabloid. 

What's sad is, we actually really need someone who IS what you claim to be - an account exposing unethical practices in the NFT space. You're just not it."
2,27,really,"How is @opensea dealing with verifications? Seems like there is no clarity on that matter. If there is no transparency, is the badge really worth something? #trustless #NFT #NFTCommunity"
3,27,really,"Love my BLU3PRINTS, but what I really dig is @abwagmi's style of free mints, fair/transparent/unique distribution methods, and pushing the bounds of what NFT's can be. 

Put your money where your vibe is. https://t.co/vKmLRPLsj1"
4,27,really,Lots of fear out there in crypto and NFTs. What it really comes down to is do you believe in the underlying technology of blockchain and have faith in your NFT community. I BELIEVE blockchain will change our lives. I have FULL TRUST in @CyberKongz . !ooh #CYBERKONGZ #NFTs
0,27,transparent,"I invest in NFT’s based on the strength of their community, clear and definable utility, capable and transparent leaders, and high quality detail oriented art.

a. KYC'ed
b. Verified Discord, Twitter, social media account... etc.
c. Donations have an upfront and transparent proof of completion process prior to NFT drop.
d. Artist has webpage link of portfolio and history
e. others"
3,27,transparent,"I analyzed a handful of big NFT collectibles Twitter pages yesterday. I have to say that @coolcatsnft are doing a fantastic job! 👌🏻

Here's a few reasons: casual, transparent, physical and digital is combined, great visuals, lots of streams, polls. 

🆒🐱🙌🏼"
4,27,transparent,"gm!

I'm one day closer to doxing myself. I personally don't believe I can take the next step up without doing so because I want to be transparent, open, and build trust.

When I have a steady income in the #NFT space, I'm going all-in and full-time.

Make today great, everyone."

1,27,definitely,"@rugpullfinder @garyvee #rugpull #Rugpulls 
yeah, definitely the ""future"" of the internet when people willingly trust and invest in rug pull projects.
Doesn't matter what the blockchain says, this is definitely a slow rug if investors have not received any utility for their #NFT items for almost a year. https://t.co/DrDN1oa8I3"

This project will become a bluechip NFT project (if it isn't already)

0,27,trust,"bandcamp and itch are maybe the only two digital storefronts i know of that i feel i can still trust, and who knows when they’ll flip too? everyone’s banning arbitrary material to appease credit card companies or falling for NFT hype. i hate art being at the mercy of tech people."
1,27,trust,patience is a virtue. one day you’re gonna regret when you didn’t trust the process of a collection and sold an #NFT underprice and it became the biggest thing and you aren’t able to buy in anymore. believe in the collection or don’t buy it in the first place you’re losing money.

That's not a moral judgement, just an observation.

Try to keep it in mind whenever you see a token or project being heavily shilled across NFT Twitter."
4,27,project,"@FatherTBOY @KingfoNFT @readyplayerh &amp; I believe this:

not enough people treat nft projects like investments in a business, but that is what it is.

Put pressure on the founders, ask hard questions, request transparency, and only invest in projects you think have a clear future."
