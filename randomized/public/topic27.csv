0,27,really,"@Chaosium_Inc I respect ur choice, but too bad ur old fans dont trust ur judgment, going to @veve_official  was smart, ethical, etc..
They should buy ur ecofriendly NFT early, if they really love @Chaosium_Inc, better than ask for it in a few years. 
See u back soon I hope ü§ò"

0,27,transparent,"If you are planning an #NFT project, here are my essential tips:

1 - Create a world, a story, a life via your #NFTs
2 - Derivate from famous or go wild; wild is where big money is
2 - A business model
3 - Aggressive Roadmap
4 - A marketing plan
5 - Be transparent

Moral of the story is, learn quick, make some mistakes, do your research, invest for the future, choose a small number of projects to really understand, don't worry about missing out on NFT drops, step back from the screen every now and then and JUST ENJOY LIFE! https://t.co/R43sUPBv3x"
