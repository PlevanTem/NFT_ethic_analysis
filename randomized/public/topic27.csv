But there are also a lot of people claiming to be good and sometimes maybe offer their help just to betray you later.

Be careful! Don't trust everybody..

1,27,good,When @Maximus_NFT shared this Alpha the floor was 0.02 ETH. I got some immediately because I trust his study. I trust the people's judgement when they put some hard work and little smart work behind their sharing. He is a good friend &amp; I know his sharing are organic no promotion.

3,27,good,"@MikeMcDonald89 NFT panic is similar to gambling moral, except it's constantly being advertised online and on TV, which is annoying for any product.

This is a good skeptical, non-hysterical take about Web3 in general from Max Read. That probably tracks with a lot of normie non-gamblers https://t.co/89lzgoORHS"
4,27,good,"@NFTethics You are doing a lot of great work that is much needed in this space. I was critical of some recent posts because i felt like they were not held to the same high standard of earlier posts.

What's sad is, we actually really need someone who IS what you claim to be - an account exposing unethical practices in the NFT space. You're just not it."

3,27,really,"Love my BLU3PRINTS, but what I really dig is @abwagmi's style of free mints, fair/transparent/unique distribution methods, and pushing the bounds of what NFT's can be.

I'm one day closer to doxing myself. I personally don't believe I can take the next step up without doing so because I want to be transparent, open, and build trust.

When I have a steady income in the #NFT space, I'm going all-in and full-time.
