Racism is the play of the old generations.

My childhood bff was a Chinese, and NO, the  community is not racist.

No matter what race the creator is, you got good NFT projects? We'll come by running (sniping?).

0,transparent,I want @NFTethics to doxx bc the smartest thing an undoxxed bad actor could do would be to transparently expose the bad actors they don't work with to clear the competition. 99% likely not the case but scamming here is next level so it doesn't hurt to ask for actual transparency
