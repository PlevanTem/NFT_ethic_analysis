Why have a project that sells out in a day? Is a quick sell out better than long term stability. Our business plan is long term growth with project loyalty. Trust!

2,ago,"if you have minted an NFT you have left an indelible mark on history

if that NFT has not sold is of no consequence

some of the most successful artists in this space minted years ago and did not really start selling until this market

be patient with yourself and trust your art"
3,ago,"@NFTethics @arvinlolme @NFTherder Hi @NFTethics, 3 months ago we still had low resolution images (800x800). We upgraded it to 4K and in January we re-rendered half of our images. To make sure there aren't any more render issue, we're giving it some time before we move everything to IPFS."
4,ago,"I’ve decided to dox myself- In a space full of rugs and anonymous teams, I’d rather you know where your money is going for full transparency

I’m Austin Adwell
I’m the artist and founder of @PudgyApes 

I joined the nft space over a year ago and bought my #bayc for  about $400 https://t.co/PCITp29t9m"
0,say,Mfs say NFT’s stupid investments but still carry cash and trust banks with there money yeah ok buddy
1,say,"What is this FUD I’m seeing on Twitter? 😡

NFT is still in the Genesis chapter, not Revelation.🚀

Can’t believe some are saying NFT momentum is dead. 

This might be confirmation bias. 

What do you think? 🧐

2,say,"@NFT_NYC @meta_angels @aslanruby @HoneyBadgesNFT ✨The Diversity Award: @thehugxyz
OK, I work for HUG, &amp;... I have honestly never been part of a more intentional community, not just saying the word diversity, but living it. HUG is leading by example, having difficult conversations + learning + growing together as a community."
3,say,"I think this needs to be said, I’ve taken way more Ls in the NFT game than Ws. A lot of people don’t talk about when they take losses, only when their investment goes up. I say this to say, no one here has a fool proof recipe to gains. DYOR and invest into projects you trust."
4,say,"@mitchliu @Theta_Network 20% for dev team  is huge great way to attract and keep talent. Most ppl won’t get what NFT liquidity mining is , but trust me when I say it’s H O T and will attract 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵"

1,right,"@jHaOdDeL @Chiknwhalegod @chikn_nft Well that's much of the reason for the hushedness and deliberate slow pace.. I feel a wide range of emotions or thoughts about the trust that has been given and the respect; its humbling and empowering at the same time. The focus now has been building the right team, and we have!"
2,right,@NFTethics So you are the one scamming people because you provide info but don't ask for anything yet they offer $100 to report you...seems legit right 🤔
3,right,"Several months ago I was scammed.. lost everything.. called out the person who scammed me, but they denied it.  

Out of curiosity I looked up that NFT this morning.. I was right! The NFT was transferred between 2 different accounts..

Moral of the story. 

BE SAFE OUT THERE"
4,right,GM ☕☀ to all the independent thinkers in #NFT land. Trust your gut. You may not always be right but it'll be right more than its wrong.  Positivity wins. https://t.co/D4wny7Pr2s
0,year,"@PopeyesNFTs It is an exceptional project. Great large and connected team, art in the making for many years, roadmap and huge potential, transparency and community. Can't ask for more than that in an NFT. I feel grateful to be along for the (long) ride!"
1,year,"I highly encourage all of my homies in the NFT community I’ve connected with and newcomers to listen to this podcast about our NFT project @VarsityClubNFT 

We’re going to do things right. 100% Authentic &amp; Transparent. This isn’t a 3 month project, this is a 30 year life project."
2,year,"I haven't owned $btc in over a year. Any of it. At all. Been a interesting ride watching markers without bias toward the orange coin. There is correlation but it is slightly decoupling with nft narratives expanding into defi and making ""value"" sinks other than btc https://t.co/xnij7INUQH"
3,year,"It can take years to build a reputation, and minutes to ruin it.

FYI, blockchain is transparent. #NFT #cryptocurrency"
4,year,"I think this work is a reflection of myself than anything else, taking the last 2 years into account I think it was so important for me to stay true to myself and trust my judgement. 

Final share before I go to bed.

1,thing,"With so much going on in the crypto/NFT space, it can get overwhelming trying to figure who or what to trust... If only there were a way to validate everything in a single place.

2,thing,"AYO! Big shoutout to @itsjustclifff and my @kamakura_nft fam. Loving the transparency, the vibes of the community, the alpha chat and the hundreds of wls from the hunters😳

The only issue is ... i need more ramen🍜🍜🍜
Can dev do something 🤣

@SolanaSensei check this out 🫠 https://t.co/xz6hYmmzfi"
3,thing,"Context is everything. @JungleFreaksNFT still super undervalued because of a misunderstanding. Don’t miss out on one of the best, welcoming and diverse communities in the NFT space. You’ll regret it. L.F.G"
4,thing,@NFT_BrainPlay @sol_nfts @SurgingBulls You've confused this project with something else fam!! Been a part of this since day one and everything has been smooth and transparent.
0,money,"Looks like March will be interesting. FOMC, subnet season w/ CRA/DFK, Evmos, Stargaze(mostly to see if an NFT market needs its own chain), equity earnings I’m watching, theta upgrade, likely Near money market, and like another long laundry list of new eco funds/raises."
1,money,"@TrizyTradez This is called Dunning-Kruger Effect. 

It is a cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.

Here is pic that illustrates your current situation. 

Wherever you invest your money you will lose it. https://t.co/yCfbDnOXrw"
2,money,"It's about showing up, showing you are trustworthy and concistency. If you launch your fist NFT's and dissapear; be aware of the fact this can kill your 'reputation'. People buy from artists they trust. And they won't forget easily. Why should they - it's their money! (2)"
3,money,"$ABQQ monster move coming.

But going forward, as a social media manager, artist and writer I’d like to build a community with like minded people, with people who can trust me from day 1 https://t.co/hjWq55U3T1"

4,know,"@SpaceRiders_NFT I wouldn't recommend projects unless I know they have a promising roadmap and I can tell this is one of them, They are currently in Phase 5 and are just advancing through it. 💯🚀

Trust me when I say this is one slept on project! 

Get in before it blows 🚀🔥

0,people,"Not true. Some people are selling art; many (most) are not. And crypto money isn’t tech money. When this *art* NFT bubble pops, we will be very lucky if some of the new collectors stick around, some new buying habits’ve formed, &amp; if equitable/transparent payments becomes a thing."
1,people,"Lots of @belugiesNFT are being swept up? Have people finally seen the work, ethics and roadmap of this project? #UgieUgie #Solana #NFT https://t.co/WEJOJYntEX"
2,people,"@beaniemaxi Looks like some people need to go back and read the article from @NFTethics. This is exactly the kind of people we need to stop supporting in the NFT space. There are a TON of hard working, well intentioned people building in the space!!! THAT’S WHO WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING!!!"
3,people,The name of the game is to never mint an #nft if you are hesitant. Most #nfts sag as people try to sell sub mint price. Trust the #NFTCommunity to tell you if it is really valuable or just another FOMO offering.
4,people,"Entering into the NFT space has been such a wild ride! Grateful for all the amazing people who have been part of our journey so far. Can't wait to see what is in store for our #creatureculturecollection future!
