1,28,ago,My analysis sparked from this discord convo a week or so ago.  Trust this team folks.  We‚Äôre early in a f‚Äôking blue chip.  Who knows what the future entails. I‚Äôm betting big on @psychedelic_nft and @BAYC2745 .  Volt is right tho. Big things like this will come with time. Patience https://t.co/PXc8LK6PHw

3,28,say,"What do you NEED from an #NFT project?

I say beyond anything is TRUST. Roadmap, utilities, staking, all means nothing if you cannot trust the project to deliver. This is why I love @DinodawgKingdom, they deliver and are fully  transparent.

0,28,right,"If every big #NFT investor decided to pump diverse, value-driven projects, it could change the whole landscape. That's how real wealth redistribution happens. 

So much opportunity and responsibility for early players to create systemic change right now! üî•"
1,28,right,"@freddurst @OMI_VeVe @veve_official It‚Äôs still better than any other NFT project. They have the biggest user base, with the most diverse licenses. It‚Äôs a lot to work out with everyone and it takes time to do it right. Investing is patience. USPS, Disney, Marvel, DC, Cartoon Network, etc. aren‚Äôt worried.."
2,28,right,"In conclusion, it is hard, especially for those who solely depend on their income on NFT sales. But it is how it is. What we can do right now is just try our best to improve. If you feel exhausted, u can always reach people within the community. Trust me, they are nice people üò∏"

0,28,year,"@NFTethics Real entrepreneurs don't have a short-term ""investment"" horizon. They often invest multiple years into early startups, without product market fit, with little financial benefit, holding the view that their hard work will pay off in the long run."
1,28,year,"It‚Äôs sad to think that most of the NFT communities in the space will be at zero in the next 3-5 years.

It‚Äôs unfair, but the over saturation is only just beginning, and just because a team is building doesn‚Äôt mean you have the brand equity to survive.

It‚Äôs a harsh reality."
