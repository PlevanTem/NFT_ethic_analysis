0,3,space,"One problem I anticipate for the NFT space: As more and more nefarious actors enter the space, there will be a push for transparency. However, obliging to this transparency will inevitably lead to increased centralization."

4,3,space,"@BamAlegre_ @NFTArenaa @NFTethics yes, it's a sweeping statement. A very necessary sweeping statement.

Waiting a few weeks is great advice to newbies."
