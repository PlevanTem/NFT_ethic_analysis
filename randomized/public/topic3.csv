0,3,dao,Stop referring to @BlockbusterDAO as “crypto bros.” @tasafila has made it a point since day one to build a core team that’s diverse and equitable. Using the term further solidifies the narrative that #web3 #nfts #daos #crypto is for yt men only. Not at #Blockbusterdao 🙏💙

1,3,diverse,"One of the things that saddens me about crypto being banned in my home country is the extraordinary and unique artworks that didn't have the opportunity to flourish in the NFT space. The chaotic history and diverse culture had major impact on art, I wish the situation will change"
