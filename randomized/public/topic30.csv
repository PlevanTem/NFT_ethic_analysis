1,30,profile,"@NFTethics All of these assertions are bogus! This isn't a basic profile picture NFT or a way to make a quick buck.

3,30,profile,"Unpopular opinion: Twitter creating NFT profile photo verification is another way for them to collect more data. Do you trust Twitter with your data? They already have data on your birthday, email, and DM conversations. This goes against Satoshi‚Äôs thesis on decentralization."

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learnt from my brief 7 months in the NFT space, the hustle can be grueling and wear one out mentally. Beneath the memes, funky art and lulz is also a lot of shady scams and exploitation of new users."
