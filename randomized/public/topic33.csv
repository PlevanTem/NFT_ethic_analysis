An ethical pricing strategy goes beyond simply following the law.

The main crux of pricing ethics concerns the establishment of a balance of power (through information) between the producer and the consumer."

4,33,follow,Need to vent a little about nft ethics. Ethics is the STUDY of right and wrong. It's NOT a list of rules that you must follow to be good person. An ethical person is one that always thinks about what's right or wrong but it doesn't mean they will reach the same conclusion as you.
