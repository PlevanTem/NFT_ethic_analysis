2,awareness,"gamers &amp; streamers need 3 things before they can start moving into nft's:

1. reassurance they won't be critisized for being skeptical or not getting it
2. awareness of ethical projects changing the world
3. reasons games will be just as enjoyable, if not more so"
3,awareness,"Confirmation bias can easily fuck up your NFT investments. Self-awareness fixes it.

Confirmation bias: the tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values."
4,awareness,"In a world where we still experience far too much discrimination, inequality and poverty, more and more NFT projects, collectors and artists are empowering women, promoting diversity, raising awareness of mental health and support amazing causes. (7/8)"
0,thats,@aitzal18 Nft ethics said something relating to someone else calling him out on lies yesterday. Who knows wats real and thats the issue… growing tired of his kind. Endless stories justifying lies to cover up manipulative behaviors are a net negative for the space
1,thats,@DoubleShineTV @TheOmniLiberal the reason I got into destiny content is because of how consistent and stoic in his beliefs. him cashing out to do nft cringe wouldn't be that big a deal if he didn't preach about moral consistency for his whole career. thats just how I feel tho
2,thats,@osf_nft @NFTethics thats the opposite of what i just read plus it came off as very condescending not a good look

3,selling,"@lostcat420 Your demonstration of a pyramid scheme is correct; it's just not applicable to NFTs.

Owning @TheOfficialHDA NFT is your verifiable, authentic, and transparent ""access pass"" to HDA-sponsored utility and mission.

0,ethical,"@RafranzDavis Yes it’s two different situations, firms are going into NFT, it can’t be avoided, so they trying to be part of it for the future so these cr/pt0 accts that aren’t ethical can be minimized.
