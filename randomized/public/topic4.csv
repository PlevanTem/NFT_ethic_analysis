1,4,awareness,"With more visibility and awareness of Pigeons of New York NFT project, the NFTs are starting to rise in value/equity.  

Pigeons of New York = The company
NFT = Your share of the company.

Treat it like you do stocks and crypto investments.  With the right project you can WIN. https://t.co/6dopaDKWZA"

0,4,mental,"@NFTethics I think it is a reason why so many artists have mental breakdown. While thinking that they aren‚Äôt good enough on the spotlight there was always treaty trades, scams, pump-dumps schemes. And it is said because artists make nft space special."

0,4,selling,@PrincessofParty @tentickletoys Pussy Riot has raised millions selling an NFT of the Ukraine flag. Sex workers worldwide are donating to help get stranded people out of targeted cities. I trust that Ukrainians are sophisticated enough to not be clutching their pearls over any of it.
