0,4,awareness,"@FriendlyJameson I'd say curation is an intentional sharing, whereas unintentional gatekeeping can come from unconscious bias that requires more awareness/effort to prevent it. obv this is a prevalent problem in the nft space outside the ash community. https://t.co/cb16lIjFrZ"

0,4,thats,"What if I told you, thats not how NFT economics work. 

And you don’t get to determine value based off your bias. 

If i stuck with my bias, I woulda been closed off to paying $15k for my first ape. 

Now look where we are.

NFT community is pretty awesome."
2,4,thats,"All holders of 1st 1000 nft pre-mint stated 4-5 SOL floor. Each holder have 5 mints (for every bull in wallet), thats another 5k. So around 6k NFTs are holders that trust in the project and already value it for min 4 sol. They won't want the price go lower, they will push it up."
3,4,thats,"And it should be plainly said, only invest money in crypto/NFT that you'd be willing to never get back, while thats unlikely, do not bet the farm on any one single investment or platform. It's far to risky and the lack of diversity exposes you to significant downside outcomes."
4,4,thats,@wgtmi33 @chikn_nft @LiamRowri yes you are. When new people come into the project I talk about how you and @amplwhalegod are both community active ethical investors and thats a HUGE selling point. Thank you so much. You are a cornerstone of this whole projects success!

0,4,mental,"A charity auction is, actually, a perfectly moral and ethical application of an NFT.

The point of a charity auction is to give the money to charity, not to receive something of value in return. So, a purely sentimental item coming from the charity's side is still virtuous."
1,4,mental,"Transparency for those who struggle; I might have done really well in many things I've tried, but it doesn't come easy, and the mental and sometimes physical toll through my life is more than overwhelming at times. I started going to therapy about a month ago #cnft #nft $ada 1/11"

3,4,mental,I assume by a ‘hater’ they mean people who are actually concerned about both the environmental impact of NFTs and the ethics of @1854 cynically switching an account which was for the British Journal of Photography into an NFT marketplace without asking their followers first.
4,4,mental,"Logically, if we sold one nft to Elon Musk for 5 million dollars, we could stop going to work and offset the environmental harm many times over by not commuting anymore. So it's ethical for us to do it."

1,4,ethical,"@sillytuna @chefgmi @mr0chill I disagree. If they do not disclose or exploit it, it is very ethical from a teleological perspective. In terms of cause and effect, the bug doesn't exist at this moment in time

A 25k bug bounty is a literal joke for any company, let alone the largest NFT marketplace"
2,4,ethical,I truly do not get the insistence/obsession with defending a multi-million-dollar company unless I'm on payroll also making millions. There is no ethical consumption under capitalism but some things are better than others and NFT /still/ isn't one of them!
3,4,ethical,"BIPOC making bank off NFT's reminds me of people who flip homes and gentrify their own communities.
