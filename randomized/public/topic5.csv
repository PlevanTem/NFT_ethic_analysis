0,5,bullish,"@NFTLlama @psychedelic_nft @RooTroopNFT @MetaMooseNFT @SappySealsNFT @EthaliensNFT Without transparency there just simply isn’t a project, a community or a future. If you don’t gain the trust of your holders what do you have? I know you’ve been an advocate for transparency since day 1 and that’s why I’m so bullish on the projects above and @Llamaverse_

1,5,bullish,"I'm bullish on my genesis collection. It gave birth to my NFT journey and made me engage with artists from all over the world. 
I'm not expecting the sold out but I'm proud and honored that some of my pieces are collected, even if it was only one.
You have to trust your NFTs."

Communication, transparency, &amp; frankly respect. What more could you ask for from your devs? 🤝

Ask yourself - Does your favorite NFT team work this hard for you?

1,5,transparent,"FINAL THOUGHTS

We are at an inflection point in the crypto / NFT markets right now.

Hyped-up projects with empty promises won't last.

Start looking for true artists, transparent teams, authenticity and long-term vision.

It doesn't get much better than Capsule House."
2,5,transparent,Already seeing new Elrond NFT projects devolving to garbage eth practices…I will never buy or participate in anything that makes me grind their f**ing discord. Just make a fair + transparent WL process  that doesn’t make ppl jump through 30 hoops ffs 😂 🤦‍♂️
3,5,transparent,"Community is EVERYTHING in the NFT space.

Rule #1 - Build trust with your community.

Rule #2 - Be transparent with your community.

Rule #3 - Find ways to reward your community.

It amazes me how many NFT projects don't understand these very simple and basic concepts."
