3,5,bullish,"#Bitcoin Dominance

Trust in Bitcoin means trust in #altcoins.

Once the dust settles on this bullish move, #alts are going to explode👀

I've seen a few trends among #altcoins, so I'm picking up a few NFT projects and some coins on the newer chains.

Note the similarities👇🏽 https://t.co/boeLJ7dm5w"

0,5,best,The best advice I can give someone interested in buying NFT's is to invest in projects and people that you trust. Pick an aesthetic that stands out and hold on for the long haul. People will begin searching for meaningful projects vs. quick pump &amp; dumps very soon. 🖖
