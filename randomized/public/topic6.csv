i would not even a little bit trust a blue check NFT account that is mostly sharing projects they‚Äôve ‚Äúpartnered‚Äù with. it‚Äôs not (just) that they‚Äôre paid promoters, it‚Äôs that these accounts are likely hacked"
1,6,account,nft I need help recovering my hacked Coinbase NFT instagram meta mask and trust wallet account.
0,6,actually,"@NFTethics @aatwts @haustwts I own several Haus. From what I recall he changed it to private after the Fud surrounding the latest drop of the Murakami flowers pieces. Do you actually have something here? If not, please don‚Äôt create unnecessary FUD. Did you reach out to him privately first?"

Not cringe and nice

Buying NFT‚Äôs because ‚Äútrust me they are worth millions‚Äù and having that transparent cope / flex stand in as your online persona = 

Cringe and odd"

1,6,thread,@NFTethics @yugalabs 1/ That everyone here is asking: what is the point of this thread? - Represents very nicely that no one can do anything with objectively researched facts anymore. Everyone is looking for the damning statement. People here have done very valuable research to be completely

We‚Äôve been clear, we put way too much trust in our initial dev- the launch was a nightmare. Blind trust in someone doing the right thing, it happens - we paid the price. We do the right thing. 

From there we engaged community devs."
1,6,rug,"Big time rugs out there and I‚Äôm yelling from the rooftops, you can come with me when I give these Kids new equipment, facilities, classrooms and supplies that the districts won‚Äôt fund. All of my work will be public. Transparency equals trust.

0,6,look,"@aboud_fn Of course HypeBears is a rug. You really think that the ""founder"" is Ernest Siow? He is a model (look him up) and a puppet that they paid to keep the real founders anonymous. Don't be naive."

0,6,like,"@sheeri @Kristin_wrote @Fieldandfen @BitchyKnitter We haven't had a fun, juicy, low-stakes knitting drama in YEARS, and we need one. Racism isn't funny, ableism isn't funny, transphobia isn't funny. But this is like our very own version of laughing at NFT scams."
1,6,like,"For the sake of transparency, we just sent 0.3 $egld to @31_pixels. He's a generous NFT artist who like our project. He will give us 50% of his earnings to help the Elrond community. These 0.3 $ egld will cover the costs of token creation. Go to follow him now! Art available soon"
0,6,project,"This is also the most transparent way for investors to see where the money is going to, through blockchain/DAO. If you‚Äôre comparing this to a traditional NFT project, you‚Äôre missing the big picture here. We are paving the way on how the future will turn ideas into businesses(2/2)"
1,6,project,"If you wonder why your fave creative just announced an NFT project, this kind of arts coverage is why. The shaky ethical and environmental foundations of NFTs, and the fact they are mostly exploitative artless grift, is entirely out of frame. Disappointing. https://t.co/ws7rBlS3WN"
