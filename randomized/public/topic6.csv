0,6,actually,@Cambesa @Nibellion I'd imagine if I had any trust in the NFT market to actually commit to that claim.
1,6,actually,@Latinfoodie There are simplifications you’ve been told  (“sign this to approve the sale of 1 NFT”) that are actually dangerously broad (“sign this to trust the other person to take only 1 NFT”). A clever person noticed the difference &amp; violated the trust. A better system would prevent this.
