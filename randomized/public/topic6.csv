0,6,actually,@Cambesa @Nibellion I'd imagine if I had any trust in the NFT market to actually commit to that claim.
1,6,actually,@Latinfoodie There are simplifications you‚Äôve been told  (‚Äúsign this to approve the sale of 1 NFT‚Äù) that are actually dangerously broad (‚Äúsign this to trust the other person to take only 1 NFT‚Äù). A clever person noticed the difference &amp; violated the trust. A better system would prevent this.
