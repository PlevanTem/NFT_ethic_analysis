WE'RE BUYING A GOLF COURSE."
1,actually,"I'm tired of getting rugged... It's time to create a plain and simple nft that thinks about its hodlers, actually delivers, and doesn't run off with everyone's money.. What happened to trust and compassion?"
2,actually,"@WryCritic Pleistocene Park itself actually made an NFT a while ago. 

Though, in fairness, I don‚Äôt expect the Zimov‚Äôs to know that much about Crypto beyond its potentially lucrative value."
3,actually,"Map is here and it‚Äôs way more exciting than any overpriced @yugalabs @OthesrsideMeta map.  @MartianPLeague is elite NFT status, Doxxed team, financially transparent, utility follow through, P2E game and a comic actually telling a story with canon, join us now or forever FOMO."
4,actually,"In a collection of 8888 NFTs, only 943 Ninjas are on sale. It actually shows how much the NFT owners trust and believe in this project. It looks like it will be difficult to get Ninja in a short time :)

2,rug,"A game takes a long time to build. Selling an NFT collection before you have a live game is cool.
But the struggle is to keep the community happy until you deliver the game. Transparent, resourceful and patient teams will figure it out, the others might succumb to the pressure."
3,rug,@NFTethics Have you interviewed the @HolyCowsNFT people? Sounds like you said - one founder hung around and tried their best to make it a success and only relinquished ownership to holders when they asked. Sounds like a flop not a rug anyway‚Ä¶
4,rug,"In crypto, there‚Äôs always a rug pull around the corner. But with @psychedelic_nft &amp; it‚Äôs transparent, trusted leader @BAYC2745, we don‚Äôt worry about that. We just let him do his thing &amp; watch him make psychedelics anonymous a blue chip, top tier NFT platform.  #NFTCommunity"
