0,6,actually,"You call yourself NFT ""Ethics"" so its even more important that you actually take the time, do the research, get the facts &amp; share verifiable data as opposed to just ""warning"" ppl based on opinion

Otherwise you're no different from any other account"
1,6,actually,"Disheartening to hear some of ya'll have made the ecosystem feel not so inclusive.  With all the pictures of #NFT.NYC how many are you seeing with diversity?  How many are actually representing the future we r trying to build? Don't give up. They don't get it, we do!

2,6,actually,Being too transparent actually hurts an NFT project
3,6,actually,"@NFTethics @WeatheReportNFT @Dentinmyhead Can we confirm that the username and # are actually of the founder and not someone pretending to be?

I'm not on the side of WR but to be using their public discord account on a server called ""NFTs anonymous"" to do this seems kinda sus to me."
4,6,actually,I reckon if permabear equity shorts made an NFT out of a picture of their p&amp;l they might actually make some money for once
0,6,transparent,"@straybits1 @NFTethics @larvalabs They did not make it clear, they only announced it after the dumping. Also if you notice they stopped after we found the burner wallet. So much for projects being transparent, they said they don‚Äôt like them after they dumped üôà"

0,6,tweet,6/ @NFTethics like this tweet from @NFTsAnonymous earlier this month. This leads to obvious questions regarding the mental health of @NFTethics. Is their judgment permanently impaired? https://t.co/E8r0d6kPvQ
1,6,tweet,"@NFTethics @DegenNFTs @aatwts @haustwts .if you think that your tweets don‚Äôt have that impact at this point, then you‚Äôre failing to recognize the collateral damage your tweets cause. So if it‚Äôs pointed at someone who is not actually doing something wrong, you‚Äôre causing significant harm to them."
2,6,tweet,"@NFTethics 6. Squiggles reached out for a retweet collab, and that‚Äôs all our association to the project was. 

You have a platform, use it wisely, not recklessly. DYOR, reach out atleast before and try to verify claims. This behavior is just as bad as rug pulls."

What if I made all my ENS holdings into an NFT. 

The ""equity"" people would get is all the ENS that are owned and then more can be bought through people minting nfts and secondary sales. Profits would be..."
1,6,nft,The fact people keep buying up these Azuki dips just shows the morals and ethics of a lot of people in the nft space.  They preach community and love but don‚Äôt give a fuck about shit but profits. Dude unapologetically rugged 3 projects and people spending 24k on this shit still

3,6,rug,"@ITorstens I've struggled as an emerging artist for 5 years. Lots of discrimination, gaslighting, toxicity and plain nepotism rife out there. Then i found NFT n I'm amazed n grateful for the sense of community n acceptance of new artists. It might take time. But patience and kindness wins."
4,6,rug,"@BobbyBananasNFT @druu_rodriguez It gives you the ability to track these people and set legal orders into place, if in fact they have done something illegal. A company failing isn‚Äôt illegal but inherently rugging(stealing money) is a crime. 

The goal is to add trust to a trust less ecosystem."

Raising Capital with NFTs is a good idea. I think it will be pretty ""Nifty""

2,6,look,@MarcDutch2 @boredapebot @boredape93 Some apes regardless of rarity just look great. Everyone has different tastes and goals‚Ä¶makes it fun to be a part of such a diverse group of collectors in the NFT space.

4,6,look,This whole $MONG thing looks like a scam now. You can‚Äòt even trust @mongs_nft anymore. I think i‚Äòll sell my 16 mongs very soon. Maybe today.
0,6,like,I‚Äôm not sure CT (excluding the crossover guys like @MoonOverlord) have gotten one thing correct about nft‚Äôs (as a more general trend - and definitely on finding stuff early) this entire run. And KBM flips bias like every 48 hrs. So do with that info what you will.
