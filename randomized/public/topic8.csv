1,8,ive,I hope the NFT space doesnt die just because there is one rotton apple in the basket. An investment is always risky there will always be unexpected events which is why diversity is important.
2,8,ive,"@NateAlexNFT From a game theory perspective, once you get to 100 or so, because the NFT will likely have real value, AND because pulling out gets you full equity value (EV), pulling out is hugely positive EV while further taking risk in the arena is negative EV.  Sure hope I get that far!"
