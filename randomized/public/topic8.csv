You go on a tangent cuz Serena W. is friends with the COO of Meta, who did something to stop an article about her former bf. You start to lose credibility. We can play 7 degrees of separation with anybody &amp; find bad actors."

1.Diverse revenue streams
2.Brand exposure
3.Commitment to decentralization
