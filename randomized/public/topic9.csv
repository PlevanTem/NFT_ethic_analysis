0,9,marketplace,"@makincryptoeasy @SafeMoonInu @beach_token @thecakemnstr @Kawakami_Inu I checked out the other projects from this and they all look great!!
TOTALLY as bias as I’m a co-founder of $BEACH but with an ERC and BSC coin, NFT marketplace in the works and over 900kg of plastics cleared from beaches all over the world already… 
@beach_token 👌👌♻️♻️"
1,9,marketplace,"Like if you’d be interested in an on-chain ERC721 marketplace.

- No royalties to the marketplace.
- No royalties to the collections.
- No 3rd parties to trust.
- No associated NFT.
- No associated ERC20 coin."
0,9,fully,"IMO the same goes for the ""random"" distribution in #NFT launches. A lot of NFT art drops are a lottery of rarity traits dressed in an aesthetic package.

The randomization mechanics in distribution should be fully auditable and transparent as well.

Don't trust, verify."
